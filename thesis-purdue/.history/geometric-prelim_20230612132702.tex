\section{Geometric Preliminaries}
Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold without boundary. Letting $\dop \Vol_g$ denote the measure on $M$ associated to the volume form of $(M,g)$, we equip the space $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth complex valued functions on $M$ with the inner product 
\begin{align*}
    \ip{f}{g} = \int_M f(x) \overline{g}(x) \dop \Vol_g(x) 
\end{align*}
and let $L^2(M,g)$ denote the completion of $C^\infty(M)$ with respect to the resulting norm.
