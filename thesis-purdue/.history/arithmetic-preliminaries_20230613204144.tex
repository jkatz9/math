\section{Arithmetic $2-$ and $3-$ manifolds}
Throughout $k$ will denote a number field, and $R$ its ring of integers. We write $V_k$ for its set of places, and write $\nu \in V_k^\infty$ (resp. $\nu \in V_k^f$) if $\nu$ is archimedian (resp. nonarchimedian).
We identify nonarchimedian places $\nu \in V_k^f$ with discrete valuations $\nu : k \to \Zbb$ on $k$ and in turn, prime ideals $\pfrak = \{ x \in k: \nu(x) > 0\}$ in $R$.
For a place $\nu \in V_k$ we write $k_\nu$ for the corresponding local field, and if $\nu \in V_k^f$ corresponding to a prime ideal $\pfrak$ of $R$ we write $R_\nu$ or $R_\pfrak$ for the closure of $R$ in $k_\nu$.
We say $\nu \in V_k^\infty$ is real (resp. complex) and write $\nu \in V_k^{\infty,\Rbb}$ (resp. $V_k^{\infty,\Cbb}$) if $k_\nu \approx \Rbb$ (resp. $\Cbb$)
% We denote by $\Abb_k$ the ring of adeles of $k$. 

Let $A$ be a quaternion algebra over $k$. We say that $A$ \textbf{ramifies} over a place $\nu \in V_k$, and write $\nu \in \Ram A$, if $A_\nu = A \otimes_k k_\nu$ is a division algebra, and otherwise \textbf{unramified} in which case $A_\nu \approx M(2,k_\nu)$.
By class field theory, the set $\Ram A$ of places over which $A$ ramifies is a finite set with even cardinality. Conversely, given any finite set $S \subset V_k$ of even cardinality and such that $S\cap V_k^{\infty,\Cbb}=\emptyset$ there is a unique quaternion algebra $A$ with $\Ram A = S$, up to isomorphism. $A$ is a division algebra if and only if $\Ram A$ is nonempty, wheras $\Ram A = \emptyset$ if and only if $A$ is isomorphic to $M(2,k)$.

Associate to  the quaternion algebra $A$ the algebraic groups over $k$ defined by
\begin{align*}
    \tilde{\Gbf}(E) = (A\otimes_k E)^\times,\quad \Gbf (E) = (A\otimes_k E)^1,\quad  \bar{\Gbf}(E) = E^\times \lmod (A\otimes_k E)^\times
\end{align*}
for any commutative $k$-algebra $E$. If $\Hbf$ is any of $\Gbf$, $\tilde{\Gbf}$, or $\bar{\Gbf}$, we write $H$ for $\Hbf(k)$, $H_\nu$ for $\Hbf(k_\nu)$, and $H_{\Abb_k}$ for $\Hbf(\Abb_k)$.

\begin{definition}
    We say $A$ is of
    \begin{itemize}
        \item    \textbf{Fuchsian-type} if: $k$ is totally real, and $A$ is unramified over exactly one real place $\nu_o$. In thise case, we use $\nu_o$ to identify $k$ with a subfield of $\Rbb$, and replace $\nu_o$-subscripts with $\Rbb$. Thus if $A$ is of fuchsian type, one has
              \begin{align}\label{eq:Fuchsian}
                  G_\Rbb \approx \GL(2,\Rbb),\quad G_\Rbb \approx \SL(2,\Rbb),\quad  \bar{G}_\Rbb \approx \PGL(2,\Rbb)
              \end{align}
        \item \textbf{Kleinian-type} if: $k$ has exactly one complex place $\nu_o$, and $A$ is ramified over all real places. In this case, use $\nu_o$ to identify $k$ with a subfield of $\Cbb$, and replace $\nu_o$-subscripts with $\Cbb$. Thus if $A$ is of Kleinian type, one has
              \begin{align}\label{eq:Kleinian}
                  G_\Cbb \approx \GL(2,\Cbb),\quad G_\Cbb \approx\SL(2,\Cbb),\quad  \bar{G}_\Cbb \approx \PGL(2,\Cbb)
              \end{align}
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
If $A$ is a quaternion algebra of Fuchsian or Kleinian type, we pick once and for all the isomorphisms in \ref{eq:Fuchsian} and \ref{eq:Kleinian}  respectively.



Recall that an order in a quaternion algebra $A$ over $k$ is a subring $O$ containing $R$ such that $kO = A$. For any order $O$, we affine group schemes over $R$ by
\begin{align*}
    \Gambfti_O(S) = (O\otimes_R S)^\times, \quad \Gambf_0(S) = (O\otimes_R S)^1, \quad \Gambfbar_O = S^\times \lmod (O\otimes_R S)^\times
\end{align*}
for any $R$-algebra $S$. Using the inclusion $R \to k$, we identify $\Gambf_O(R)$ with a subgroup $\Gamma_O$ of $G=\Gambf_O(k)$ and, in turn, a subgroup of $G_\nu$ for any place $\nu$.

If $A$ is of Fuchsian (resp. Kleinian) type then  for any order $O$,   $\Gamma_O$ is a lattice in $G_\Rbb  \approx \SL(2,\Rbb)$ (reps. in $G_\Cbb\approx \SL(2,\Rbb)$). We call $\Gamma_O$ the \textbf{arithmetic lattice associated to} $O$.
\begin{definition}
    A subgroup $\Lambda$ of $\SL(2,\Rbb)$ (resp. $\SL(2,\Cbb)$) is \textbf{arithmetic} if there exists a quaternion algebra $A$ over a number field $k$ of Fuchsian (resp. Kleinian) type and an order $O$ in $A$ such that $\Lambda$ is commensurable (in the wide sense) with the arithmetic lattice $\Gamma_{O}$ associated to $O$. We say that $\Lambda$ is \textbf{derived} from the order $O$ if it is conjugate in $\SL(2,\Rbb)$ (resp. $\SL(2,\Cbb)$) to a subgroup of $\Gamma_O$.
\end{definition}

The following basic facts will be used in what follows.
\begin{facts}
    % Let $A$ be a quaternion algebra of Fuchsian or Kleinian type.
    \begin{enumerate}
        Let $\Kbb = \Rbb$ or $\Cbb$.
        \item\label{item:orders} If $O,O'$ are two orders in a quaternion algebra $A$, then $\Gamma_O$ and $\Gamma_{O'}$ are commensurable in $G=A^1$. Consequently, the property of being commensurable in $G_\Kbb$ to an order in $A$ depends only on $A$.
        \item If $O,O'$ are orders in quaternion algebras $A,A'$ over number fields $k,k'$ with $A_\Kbb = A'_\Kbb$ such that $\Gamma_O$ is commensurable to $\Gamma_O'$ in $A_\Kbb^1 = {A^1}{\Kbb}^1$ then $k=k'$ and $A = A'$. Consequently, the quaternion algebra is an invariant of the commensurability class of an arithmetic lattice in $\SL(2,\Kbb)$.
        \item The quaternion algebra of an arithmetic lattice in $\SL(2,\Kbb)$ is a complete invariant of its commensurability class.
        \item An arithmetic lattice is cocompact if and only if its quaternion algebra is a division algebra.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{facts}

\paragraph{Principal congruence subgroups}
For an ideal $\afrak$ of $R$, the reduction map $R \to R/\afrak$ induces an epimorpshim of groups $\Gamma \to \Gambf (R/\afrak)$. We write $\Gamma_O(\afrak)$ for the kernel, and refer to it as the \textbf{principal congruence subgroup of level } $\afrak$ in $\Gamma_O$. To summarize, for each ideal $\afrak$ of $R$, there is a short exact sequence of groups
\begin{align*}
    1 \to \Gamma_O (\afrak) \to \Gamma_O=\Gambf_O(R) \to \Gambf (R/\afrak) \to 1.
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
    \Gamma_O(\afrak) = \{ g \in O^1: g \in 1 + \afrak O\}
\end{align*}
and $\Gambf (R/\afrak)$ is a fintie group. We define principal congruence subgroups $\Gamti$ and $\Gambar$ similarly.

\paragraph{Type number}
We say that $O$ is a maximal order in $A$ if it is not properly contained in any other order. Maximal orders exist in any quaternion algebra over $k$. The group $\Gti = A^\times$ (through its quotient $\Gbar = k^\times \lmod A^\times$) on the set of maximal orders in $A$. We say that $A$ has  \textbf{type-number 1} if this action is transitive, i.e. all maximal orders in $A$ are conjugate by an element of $A^\times$.
\begin{remark}\label{remark:classnum}
    The number conjugacy classes of maximal orders in a quaternion algebra $A$ over a number field $k$ is always finite, and divides the order of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the class group of $k$. Consequently if $k$ class number $1$
