We
say
that
an

R
is
hyperbolic
if

In
this

is

to

We

The

Let

denote
the

of

 section  Background on fields of moduli fields of definition 
Here   S  is a smooth algebraic curve footnote over   C    and  k  subset  C  is a field  Say that  k  is  emph a   textbf field of definition  for  S  if there exist  J  homogeneous polynomials  F j in k x     cdots  x n   such that  S  C   and
    S F   set x in  CP n  mid F j x      text  for all j    
are isomorphic footnote complex analytically   
Given a set  F  of homogeneous generators for the ideal defining   S   and an element   sigma  in   Gal  Qbar    Qbb     one can define  S   F  sigma   as above  with coefficients of the polynomials conjugated by   sigma   The  textbf inertia subgroup    I S  leq  Gal    Qbar    Qbb    consists of those   sigma  in  Gal  Qbar  Qbb   such that  S  F  sigma   approx S F   as footnote presumably  complex analytic varieties  Apparently this subgroup is independent  perhaps up to conjugation   of the choice of model   The fixed field   Qbbar  I S    Fix I S   is the  textbf field of moduli  for  S   which we denote by  M S     The field of moduli is contained in any field of definition  though not every curve is defined over its field of moduli  That is   M S   may not be a field of definition for  S  
If  G  Aut S   say that  k  is a field of definition for the pair   S G   if there exists a model  S F  of  S  over  k  and an isomorphism   phi S F  to S  such that   phi  inv G  phi    Aut S F   is also defined over  k   Then the inertia group of the pair is
   I   S G       set  sigma  in  Gal  Qbbar  Q   mid  parbox t     linewidth   there exists an isomorphism  f  sigma  S to S  sigma  such that   alpha  sigma  circ f  sigma   f  sigma  circ  alpha  for all   alpha  in G       
Write  M S G   for the field of moduli for the pair 
Now  given a belyi function   beta S to  CPone  defining a dessin   Dcal  on  S   define the group of automorphisms of   S  beta   to be the subgroup of   Aut S   such that   beta circ f   beta   equality of functions  S to  CPone    We also write   Aut  Dcal   for   Aut S  beta   
For any model  S F  as above    beta  circ  phi  is a rational function on  S F   Say that  k  is a field of definition of   S  beta    or   Dcal   if there exists a model  S F  of  S  such that both  F  and the covering   beta  circ  phi  are defined over  k   Define the inertia subgroup similarly to above and define  M  Dcal  M S  beta   to be its fixed field  the field of moduli for   Dcal   Note  I  S  beta    I S  so  M S   M S  beta  
Say a belyi function is regular if it defines a normal covering  S to S G approx  CPone   for some subgroup  G  of   Aut S   
 begin lemma 
 If  S  is quasiplatonic with surface group   Gamma  triangleleft  Delta  for a maximal triangle group   Delta   then  M S  M S  beta   for the belyi function   beta  Gamma  lmod  Hbb  to  Delta  lmod  Hbb  
 end lemma 
If   Delta  is not maximal   say  for example   r s  neq t   then there exist a   sigma  in I S  fixing  S  but exchanging the zero set of its belyi function  B  and the zero set of    B  such that  M S B    can be  a quadratic extension of  M S   
 begin thm 
 Let  S  be a quasiplatonic curve of genus  g    with full automorphism group  G  Aut S    If  Z G  leq G  is a direct factor off  G   i e   G G  times Z G    then   S G   can be defined over its field of moduli  M S G   
 end thm 
Note  this theorem applies to   PGL    and   PSL    and direct products of them with  C    s  A consequence  if  U leq G  and  C U lmod S   a cover of  G lmod S   covered by  S    then  C  can be defined over  M S G    Further  all such  S  can be simultaneously defined over  M S G   in the sense that all the function fields  M S G  C   are subfields of  M S G  S   
 section  Hurwitz groups and surfaces 
Say  G  is a hurwitz group if it is a quotient of   Delta         by a finite index torsion free normal subgroup  A theorem of Macbeath characterizes those  q  for which   PSL    Fbb q   is a hurwitz group  The cases are as follows 
 begin itemize 
  item  q    
  item  q p  for  p  prime   pm    mod     
  item  q p    for  p  prime and  p   pm    or   pm    mod     
 end itemize 
See  cite dzambicMacbeathsInfiniteSeries      for details on the following arithmetic construction of Macbeath s curves  Given a number field  k  let   Ocal k  be its ring of integers  Let  A  be the indefinite quaternion algebra defined over  k  Q  cos pi     unramified at all finite places  Then   Delta         is the image of the norm     subgroup of  A  under canonical inclusion  A  to  GL    R   induced by the unique split real place  followed by the surjection   GL    R   to  PGL    R    Further    Delta  can be realized as a subgroup of   PSL    Ocal L   for an  at worst  quadratic extension of  k  
For a rational prime  p  in  Z   the ideal  p Ocal k  is 
  begin itemize 
   item ramified if  and only if   p     in this case  p Ocal k  pfrak    for some prime   pfrak  leq  Ocal k  with  N  pfrak     
   item split if  and only if   p  pm    mod      in this case  p Ocal k  pfrak    pfrak    pfrak    with primes   pfrak i  leq  Ocal k  of norm  p 
   item inert if and only if   p  pm    or   pm    mod      in this case  p Ocal k  pfrak  remains prime  and has norm  p    
  end itemize 
Now let   Delta  Delta r s t   be any  emph arithmetic  triangle group  realized as the norm     units   Mcal    of a maximal order   Mcal  of a quaternion algebra  A  over a totally real field footnote apparently  as first observed by Takeuchi  all of the arithmetic triangle groups have trace fields with class number one  Consequently  for all such  k   every ideal   pfrak  pi  Ocal k  for some prime element   pi  of   Ocal k     k   Let  A  pfrak  be the local quaternion algebra defined over the   pfrak  adic field  k  pfrak  
So long as   pfrak  doesnt divide the discriminant of  A   the local quaternion alg  A  pfrak  is isomorphic to  M   k  pfrak    Let   Delta  pfrak   denote the principal congruence subgroup of level   pfrak   Then all of the surfaces   Delta  pfrak   lmod  Hbb  have a regular belyi function   beta  S  Delta  pfrak   lmod  Hbb  to  Delta  lmod  Hbb  and has automorphism group of order   abs Aut S    abs N  Delta  pfrak    Delta  pfrak    where  N  denotes the   PSL    R   normalizer of   Delta  pfrak   
The principal congruence subgroups of level   pfrak n  of the local quaternion algebra correspond to the intersections of certain collections of maximal orders  More precisely  the principal congruence subgroup of level   pfrak n  corresponds to  norm one units of  the intersection of all of the vertices in the Bruhat Tits tree of distance   leq n  from the root 
Let   Ecal  pfrak  denote the Eichler order of level   pfrak  in  A  pfrak   that is  the intersection of the two maximal orders   Mcal  pfrak  and   gamma  inv  Mcal  Pfrak  gamma    where   gamma  tbt  pi             Let   Phi    pfrak   Ecal  pfrak    denote the norm     subgroup of   Ecal  pfrak   The  textbf fricke element    tbt     pi   inv          in A  pfrak  conjugates one maximal order into the other  and so preserves their intersection   Ecal  pfrak   and induces an involution on   Phi    pfrak    Globally  the fricke involution may give rise to a matrix in   GL    R   which conjugates two triangle groups  By the rigidity of triangle groups  such a conjugation can be realized inside   PSL    R    hence gives rise to an involution   alpha  pfrak  which generates a  C    extension   Delta  f   pfrak    langle alpha  pfrak   Delta    pfrak   rangle  of   Delta    pfrak    called the Fricke extension 
Now   alpha  pfrak  normalizes   Delta    pfrak   but  emph not    Delta   though   alpha  pfrak    in  Delta    pfrak    Conjugation by   alpha  pfrak  induces an involution on the curve   Delta    pfrak  lmod  Hbb   Note    alpha  pfrak  in  PSL    R   may not have order two  despite it inducing an involution on the curve   Delta    pfrak   lmod  Hbb  
Consequently  any group  K leq  Delta    pfrak   is a subgroup of both   Delta  and   alpha  pfrak  Delta  alpha  pfrak  inv   and consequently possess two distinct uniform dessins on  K lmod  Hbb  
The discussion also applies verbatim for prime powers  we obtain subgroups   Delta    pfrak j   leq  Delta    pfrak    involutions   alpha   pfrak j    and extensions   Delta  fr   pfrak j   langle  Delta    pfrak j   alpha   pfrak j  rangle    Now    Delta      pfrak j   is normal in   Delta  fr   pfrak j    but none of   Delta    pfrak  ell   is normal in   Delta  fr   pfrak j   for  j  ell   Nor are any of its   Delta  conjugates   Delta   i  pfrak  ell   
 begin lemma 
  begin itemize 
   item For each  j    cdots n  there are  q  j    q     congruence subgroups   Delta   i  pfrak j    each conjugate to   Delta    pfrak j    in   Delta   for  i    cdots q  j    q       
   item  Each of them is contained in   Delta   and in  j  different triangle groups conjugate to   Delta    textbf in which   Delta  pfrak n   is included non normally  
   item Every   Delta   i  pfrak j   is the intersection of   Delta  with a conjugate triangle group   Delta  j i    and for fixed  j   the different   Delta  i j   form an orbit under   Delta  conjugation 
  end itemize 
 end lemma 
  begin proof 
  Proceed by induction on  j   The group   Delta    pfrak   has index  q    in   Delta   and for each class   rho i  in  Delta  modulo   Delta    pfrak   for  i    cdots  q  set   Delta   i  pfrak     rho i   Delta    pfrak   rho i  inv  for   rho    id   cdots   rho q  such that   Delta  pfrak n   triangleleft  Delta   i  pfrak     Delta  
  For each of them  let   alpha i    rho i  alpha  pfrak  rho i  inv  be its fricke involution  where   alpha  pfrak  is the one for   Delta    pfrak     Then form the corresponding Fricke extension   Delta  fr  i  pfrak   which is properly contained in   Delta  
  The conjugacy of the different   Delta   i  pfrak j   for fixed  j  comes from the following interpretation  consider the  textbf fake projective line    Pbb    Ocal k  pfrak j   consisting of pairs   x y   in   Ocal k    pfrak j     not both coordinates divisible by   pfrak   modulo the diagonal action of    Ocal k    pfrak j   times    The action of   Delta  on this fake projective line is transitive  and the subgroups   Delta   i  pfrak j   are the point stabilizers

\title{An observation reguarding coordinate rings}
\author{Justin Katz}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
A question: is the coordinate ring $K[V]=\{ f \mid_V : f \in K[\Abb_K^n] \}$ of an affine variety $V$ \emph{literally} the set of regular maps $V \to \Abb^1_K$. Is there a canonical ring structure on the latter?
Consider $\Abb^1_K$ as a 1 dimensional variety over $K$. Its automorphism group is $K^\times \rtimes K$, which acts transitively on its points, though not $K$ linearly

\title{Decomposing unitary representations of locally compact groups}
\author{Justin Katz}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
Let $G$ be a locally compact group, which we will always assume to be Hausdorff and second countable. Let $D$ be the collection of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations $\pi$ such that for any (hence all) nonzero $u,v\in \H_{\pi}$ the function $\phi_{\pi,u,v}:x \mapsto \ip{\pi(x)u}{v}_{\pi}$ is in $L^{2}(G)$. If $\pi \in D$, then $\phi_{\pi,u,v}$ generates a subrepresentation (a closed invariant subspace) of the right regular representation $R$ in $L^{2}(G)$ that is isomorphic to $\pi$. Let $\E_{\pi}$ denote the image in $L^{2}(G)$ of the functions $\phi_{\pi,u,v}$. Define two subspaces of $L^{2}(G)$: 
	\begin{align*}
		L^{2}_{\disc}(G)&=\bigoplus_{\pi \in D}\E_{\pi} \qquad \text{(Hilbert space direct sum)}\\
		L^{2}_{\cts}(G)&=(L^{2}(G)_{\disc})^{\top}, 
	\end{align*}
We call these the discrete and continuous parts of $L^{2}(G)$ respectively. By construction, $L^{2}_{\disc}(G)$ is absolutely reducible: if $C(\pi,R)$ denotes the space of unitary operators intertwining $\pi$ and $R$, set $m(\pi)=\dim C(\pi,R)$. Then 
	\begin{align*}
		L^{2}_{\disc}(G)\approx \bigoplus_{\pi \in D} \pi^{\oplus m(\pi)}.
	\end{align*}
Whereas, by construction $L^{2}_{\cts}(G)$ has no irreducible subrepresentations.
\par In these notes, I follow Folland (A course in abstract harmonic analysis) showing that $L^{2}_{\cts}(G)$ decomposes as a \emph{direct integral} (a generalization of direct \emph{sum}) over irreducible representations. 
\section{Direct integrals}
\subsection{...of trivial Hilbert bundles} Let $(A,\M,\mu)$ be a measure space, and $(\H,\ip{\cdot}{\cdot}_{\H},|\cdot|_{\H})$ a Hilbert space which we will always assume to be separable. We want to form a new Hilbert space `over $A$.'  A naive approach is to make the underlying vectorspace 
	\begin{align*}
		\left[\int_{A}^{\bigoplus}\H \dop \mu\right]_{\nai}=\bigoplus_{\alpha \in A} \H.
	\end{align*}
The elements of this space are then finitely supported $\H$ valued functions on $A$ with norm given by $|f|^{2}_{\nai}=\sum_{\alpha \in A} |f(\alpha)|_{\H}^{2}$. In the case that $A$ is uncountable, there is no way that this will be complete.
\par The missing ingredient from the naive approach was the measure-structure on $A$.  Rather than requiring that the functions be finitely \emph{supported}, we instead require that the functions be \emph{square-integrable}, in the sense that the function 
	\begin{align*}
		\alpha \mapsto |f(\alpha)|^{2}_{\H} 
	\end{align*}
is square-integrable over $A$. This is the right idea: define the {\bf direct integral} of $\H$ over $A$ with respect to $\mu$ to be 
	\begin{align*}
		\int^{\oplus}_{A}\H \dop \mu=L^{2}(A,\H,\mu)=\set{f:A \to \H}{|f|^{2}=\int_{A} |f(\alpha)|^{2}_{\H}\dop \mu(\alpha)<\infty} / \ker(|\cdot|^{2}).
	\end{align*}
This is the direct integral of the {\bf trivial Hilbert bundle} in the sense that the Hilbert space $\H$ is fixed as we vary over $A$. We need to generalize this to allow a family of spaces $H_{\alpha}$ for $\alpha \in A$.
\subsection{... of general Hilbert bundles}
Throughout this section, fix the following data and terminology:

		\item {\bf The `fibers'}: For each $\alpha\in A$ a separable Hilbert space $\H_{\alpha}$ with norm and inner product denoted $|\cdot|_{\alpha}$ and $\ip{\cdot}{\cdot}_{\alpha}$ respectively.
		\item {\bf A choice of `basis sections'}: A countable set $\E$ of maps $e:A \to \coprod_{\alpha\in A} \H_{\alpha}$ such that 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item  $e_{\alpha} \in \H_{\alpha}$ for all $\alpha \in A$ (think: section of a bundle).
				\item For fixed $e,e'\in \E$, the map $\alpha \mapsto \ip{e_{\alpha}}{e'_{\alpha}}$ is measurable. 
				\item For a fixed $\alpha \in A$, the set $\{e_{\alpha}\}$ is a Hilbert space basis of $\H_{\alpha}$.
			\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
This data defines a {\bf Hilbert bundle} over $A$.  A function $f:A\to \coprod_{\alpha \in A}\H_{\alpha}$ such that $f_{\alpha} \in \H_{\alpha}$ is called a {\bf section}. A section is {\bf measurable} if the map $\alpha \mapsto \ip{f_{\alpha}}{e_{\alpha}}_{\alpha}$ is, for each $e \in \E$. 
\begin{remark}
	In practice, Hilbert spaces are typically spaces of functions. Since sections are then `function valued functions,' I denote evaluation at $\alpha \in A$ as a subscript.
\end{remark}
\begin{defn}
The {\bf direct integral} of the Hilbert bundle above (with respect to $\mu$) is 
	\begin{align*}
		\int^{\oplus}_{A}\H_{\alpha}\dop \mu(\alpha)= \{ f: A \to \coprod_{\alpha\in A} \H_{\alpha}| \quad f_{\alpha}\in\H_{\alpha}, \quad \int_{A}|f_{\alpha}|^{2}_{\alpha}\dop \mu(\alpha)<\infty\} / \sim
	\end{align*}
where $\sim$ denotes agreement away from set of measure zero. The elements of the direct integral are called {\bf square integrable sections} of the Hilbert bundle. 
\end{defn}
Verification that this is a Hilbert space, with the inner product $\ip{f}{g}=\int_{A}\ip{f_{\alpha}}{g_{\alpha}}_{\alpha}\dop \mu (\alpha)$ is roughly the same argument that $L^{2}(A,\mu)$ is, along with Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem.
%\begin{ex}
%	Let $A=\{1,2\}$, with $\M=2^{A}$ and $\mu$ the counting measure. Take $\H_{1}$ and $\H_{2}$ to be $1$-dimensional complex vectorspaces, say $H_{1}=\C v_{1}$ and $H_{2}=\C v_{2}$ for any nonzero $v_{\alpha} \in\H_{\alpha}$. Then\footnote{The choice of basis sections $e_{i}$ was tacit in writing $H_{\alpha}$ in terms of basis vectors. To be totally explicit, the single section $e:A\to \H_{1}\coprod\H_{2}$ defined by $e_{\alpha}= v_{\alpha}$ suffices. If $f:A \to \H_{1}\coprod \H_{2}$ is any section, say $f(1)=c_{1}v_{2}$ and $f(2)=c_{2}v_{2}$, then measurability of $f$ is tantamount to the map $\alpha \mapsto \ip{f_{\alpha}}{e_{\alpha}}=c_{\alpha} \cdot \overline{1}=c_{\alpha}$ being measurable. Since every subset of $A$ is measurable this is vacuous.}
%	\begin{align*}
%		\int^{\oplus}_{A}\H_{\alpha}\dop \mu(\alpha)= \set{f:\{1,2\}\to \C}{f(1) \in \C v_{1}, \hsp f(2) \in \C v_{2}, \hsp |f(1)|^{2}+|f(2)|^{2}<\infty} 
%	\end{align*}
%Square integrability is vacuous here.
%\end{ex}
The following are some quick exercises that I think are pretty important to grasp `what's going on.'
\begin{ex}
\begin{itemize}
		%\item Make it absolutely clear that this is just $\H_{1}\oplus \H_{2}$. \\
		\item Let $A$ be a countable set, $\mu$ the counting measure on $A$, with arbitrary (separable) $\H_{\alpha}$ for all $\alpha \in A$.  Show
				\begin{align*}
					\int^{\oplus}_{A}\H_{\alpha}\dop \mu(\alpha) \approx \bigoplus_{\alpha \in A} \H_{\alpha}. 
				\end{align*}\\
		\item  Define a map $H_{\alpha'}\to \int^{\oplus}\H_{\alpha}\dop \mu(\alpha)$ by $v \mapsto f$ where $f$ is the function on $A$ such that $f_{\alpha}=0$ unless $\alpha=\alpha'$, whereat $f_{\alpha'}=v$. For arbitrary $\mu$ on $A$, why is this not necessarily an embedding? 		
\end{itemize}
\end{ex}
\subsection{... of operators}
	Consider a collection of unitary operators $T_{\alpha} \in \L(\H_{\alpha})$, (the latter is the space of bounded operators on $\H_{\alpha}$) such that for any measurable section $\alpha \mapsto f_{\alpha}$, the section $\alpha \mapsto T_{\alpha} f_{\alpha}$ is measurable. Such a collection is called a {\bf measurable field of operators}. Such a field gives rise to a unitary\footnote{Exercise: check this} operator on $\int^{\oplus}_{A}\H_{\alpha}\dop \mu(\alpha)$ called the {\bf direct integral of the field $T$},  denoted $\int^{\oplus}_{A}T_{\alpha} \dop \mu(\alpha)$ or just $\int^{\oplus}T$ if the rest of the data is clear. This operator acts on square integrable sections fibre--wise, 
	\begin{align*}
		\left[\left(\int^{\oplus}_{A}T_{\alpha} \dop \mu(\alpha)\right) f\right]_{\alpha}=T_{\alpha}f_{\alpha}. 
	\end{align*}
\begin{ex}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Let $A$ be a finite set, and $\mu$ be the counting measure. Fix a Hilbert space $\H$ of dimension $1$. Characterize the operators in $\int^{\oplus}_{A}\H \dop \mu(\alpha)$ that arise as the direct integral of $|A|$ operators on $\H$.
		%Take the $A=\{1,2\}$ example from above. Then any operator in $\L(\C v_{\alpha})$ acts by scaling. Pick $\xi_{\alpha}\in \C$ of norm $1$. Define a collection of unitary operators on $\H_{\alpha}$ by $T(\alpha)v_{\alpha}=\xi_{\alpha}v_{\alpha}$. Then if $f\in \int^{\oplus}_{A}H_{\alpha}\dop \mu(\alpha)$, and $f(\alpha)=c_{\alpha}v_{\alpha}$, the direct integral of the field $F$ acts on $f$ by $\left(\int^{\oplus}T\right)f(\alpha)=\xi_{\alpha}f(\alpha)=(\xi_{\alpha}c_{\alpha})v_{\alpha}$. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{ex}
\subsection{... of representations}
	Let $G$ be a locally compact group and consider a collection of unitary representations $\pi_{\alpha}:G \mapsto \L(\H_{\alpha})$. Further, suppose that for each $x\in G$ the field of operators $\pi_{\alpha}(x)$  is measurable, so that $\int^{\oplus} \pi_{\alpha} (x)\dop \mu (\alpha)$ defines a unitary operator on $\int^{\oplus}\H_{\alpha} \dop \mu(\alpha)$. We call such a collection a {\bf field of unitary representations}. The map $x\mapsto \int^{\oplus}\pi(x)\dop \mu(\alpha)$ then defines a unitary representation\footnote{Exercise: check this.} of $G$ on $\int^{\oplus}\H_{\alpha} \dop \mu(\alpha)$.

\section{Decomposing unitary representations}
The theorem of this section, which decomposes a unitary representation into a direct integral of a field of representations, is phrased in terms of a choice of commutative ($C^{*}$, weakly closed) algebra of intertwining operators. Let's look at how this manifests in the simplest case: 
Consider a finite group $G$, with an irreducible unitary representation of $\pi$ on finite dimensional Hilbert space  $V$. Now suppose $\tau$ is a unitary representation of $G$ on $W$ which is unitarily equivalent to $\pi\oplus\pi$ on $V\oplus V$. The algebra of intertwining operators $\Hom_{\tau}(W,W)$ is isomorphic to $M_{2}(\C)$ (basically Schur's lemma). 
\begin{claim}
	A choice of isomorphism $\tau \approx \pi \oplus \pi$ is equivalent to a choice of maximal commutative subalgebra of $\Hom_{\tau}(W,W)$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
	Given an isomorphism $\phi:W\to V\oplus V$ intertwining $\tau$ and $\pi \oplus \pi$, take the preimage of the algebra of diagonal matrices in $\End(V)\oplus\End(V)$. 
	\par Given a maximal commutative subalgebra $B$ of $\Hom_{\tau}(W,W)$, all operators in $B$ can be simultaneously diagonalized. Since $\Hom_{\tau}(W,W)$ is isomorphic to $M_{2}(\C)$, $B$ must be two dimensional, so pick basis vectors $T,S$. Since $T,S$ are linearly independent, there must be an eigenspace $W_{1}$ on which their eigenvalues are distinct. Since $T,S$ are intertwining operators $W_{1}$ is a $\tau$ invariant subspace (which is necessarily proper). Conclude that $W_{1}$ is equivalent to $V$, and by Schur, the equivalence is unique up to scale. The same argument shows that the orthogonal complement $W_{2}$ to $W_{1}$ is also equivalent to $V$. After taking some linear combination of $T$ and $S$, we may assume that $T$ and $S$ are projections onto $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ respectively. Then $T\oplus S$ provides a $G$ isomorphism $W\to W_{1}\oplus W_{2}\to V\oplus V$.
\end{proof}
Paraphrasing: to decompose $W$ into its irreducible subrepresentations, one must make a choice of orthogonal projections onto its invariant subspaces, which is a commutative subalgebra of intertwining operators. Now suppose $G$ is a locally compact group and $\pi=\int^{\oplus}\pi_{\alpha}$ on $\H=\int^{\oplus}\H_{\alpha}$. Take a measurable subset $E\subset A$ and let $\chi_{E}$ be its characteristic function. Define an operator on $\int^{\oplus}\H_{\alpha}$ by $\left[M_{E}f\right]_{\alpha}=\chi_{E}(\alpha)f_{\alpha}$. Then\footnote{Exercise: check this} $M_{E}$ is a projection onto a closed $\pi$--invariant subspace of $\H$. Note that the collection of $M_{E}$ for all measurable $E$ commute with one another, and will generate a commutative $C^{*}$ algebra of intertwining operators. 
\par The reference to such algebras in the following theorem is what allows one to modulate the fine-ness of the direct integral decomposition. On one extreme, a maximal commutative subalgebra of intertwining operators implies that the representations appearing in the direct integral are \emph{irreducible}. On the other, the zero subalgebra makes the theorem vacuous. 
\begin{thm}
	Let $G$ be a locally compact group, $\pi$ be a unitary representation on a separable Hilbert space $\H$, and $B$ a weakly closed commutative $C^{*}$ algebra of intertwining operators $\H \to \H$.  Then there exists 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item a measure space $(A,\M,\mu)$,
			\item a field of Hilbert spaces $\H_{\alpha}$ over $A$,
			\item a field of representations $\pi_{\alpha}\in \L(\H_{\alpha})$ over $A$, 
			\item a unitary isomorphism $U: \H \to \int^{\oplus}_{A}\H_{\alpha}\dop \mu(\alpha)$
		\end{itemize}
	such that
		\begin{align*}
			U\pi U^{-1}= \int^{\oplus}_{A}\pi_{\alpha}\dop \mu(\alpha)
		\end{align*}
	and 
		\begin{align*}
			U B U^{-1} \text{ is the algebra of diagonal operators on $\int^{\oplus}\H_{\alpha}\dop \mu(\alpha)$}
		\end{align*}
\end{thm}
By analogy to the Euclidean Fourier transform (of which this is a direct generalization), denote $U(\cdot)$ by $\hat{\cdot}$. Remind yourself that this means $\hat{v}$ is a function on $A$, taking a value in $H_{\alpha}$ at $\alpha\in A$.  This theorem says that the action of $\pi$ on $v$ is given by 
	\begin{align*}a
		\pi(x) v= U^{-1} \left (\alpha\mapsto \pi_{\alpha}(x) [\hat{v}(\alpha)]\right)
	\end{align*}
and for any operator $T\in B$, there exists a $\phi \in L^{\infty}(A)$ such that 
	\begin{align*}
		Tv=U^{-1} \left[\alpha \mapsto \phi(\alpha) \hat{f}(\alpha)\right].
	\end{align*}
\1
\subsection{A brief interlude on the unitary dual}
	As a set, denote by $\hat{G}$ the collection of irreducible unitary representations modulo unitary equivalence. In this section, I will briefly describe a $\sigma$--algebra of subsets of $\hat{G}$ which, when $G$ is `good,' will let $\hat{G}$ serve as $A$ universally in the theorem above. 
	
	\par For each $n<\infty$, let $\H_{n}$ denote a fixed Hilbert space of dimension $n$ (say $\C^{n}$ with the Euclidean inner product), and let $\H_{\infty}$ denote a fixed infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space (say $\ell^{2}(\Z)$). Now for each $n$ let $\irr_{n}(G)$ denote the collection of irreducible unitary representations of $G$ on $\H_{n}$. Note: we are not identifying unitarily equivalent representations \emph{yet}. Let $X_{n}$ denote the collection of matrix coefficient functions on $\irr_{n}(G)$; i.e. maps $\irr_{n}(G) \to \C$ of the form 
	\begin{align*}
		\pi \mapsto \ip{\pi(x)u}{v}.
	\end{align*}
Then set $B_{n}$ to be the $\sigma$-algebra on $\irr_{n}(G)$ generated by $X_{n}$; i.e. the smallest $\sigma$--algebra containing  \emph{all} preimages of subsets of $\C$ under \emph{all} maps in $B_{n}$.
 
 \par Now let
	\begin{align*}
		\irr(G)= \bigcup_{n\leq \infty} \irr_{n}(G).
	\end{align*}
Because we have not made any identifications, this union is disjoint. Define a $\sigma$-algebra on $B$ by 
	\begin{align*}
		E \in B \iff E\cap \irr_{n}(G) \in B_{n} \text{ for all $n$}.
	\end{align*}
Now let $\cdot \mapsto [ \cdot ]$ be the map taking a unitary representation to its unitary equivalence class, which is a surjection $\irr(G) \to \hat{G}$. Then define a $\sigma$--algebra, called the {\bf Borel--Mackey} structure on $\hat{G}$, by pulling back along $[\cdot]$. 
\par Aside: there is also a topology on $\hat{G},$ called the Fell topology. The $\sigma$--algebra of Borel subsets with respect to the Fell topology is coarser than the Borel--Mackey algebra. In particular, singletons are in the Borel--Mackey algebra, but need not be in the Borel--Fell algebra. In any case, one should expect that the Fell topology is not Hausdorff at a handful of points, arising when a `continuous' family of unitary irreps degenerate. 
\1
\subsection{Some representation theoretic definitions}
To strengthen the decomposition theorem above, we will need to isolate a class of groups for which $\hat{G}$ is `good.' We need some definitions to make this precise. 
\par A measurable space $(X,\M)$ is {\bf standard} if it is measurably isomorphic to a Borel subset of a complete separable metric space\footnote{Astonishingly (to me at least), there are only two options for such spaces: either $X$ is countable and $\M=2^{X}$, or $X$ is measurably isomorphic to $[0,1]$ with its Euclidean topology and its $\sigma$-algebra of Borel sets.}.
\par A unitary representation $\pi$ of $G$ is {\bf primary} if the center of its algebra of intertwining operators is trivial (scalar multiples of the identity). Schur says that irreducible representations are primary, and if $\pi$ is completely reducible (as a direct sum) then it is primary if and only if all of its irreducible subrepresentations are unitarily equivalent (the example of $\tau$ on $W$ above is an example).
\par A group $G$ is said to be {\bf type I} if every primary representation is a direct \emph{sum} of some irreducible subrepresentation. \emph{These are the `good' groups}
\begin{thm}
	A locally compact group $G$ is type I if and only if its Borel-Mackey  $\sigma$--algebra is standard. 
\end{thm}
\1
 \subsection{Strengthening the decomposition}
For each $n\leq \infty$, let $\hat{G}_{n} \subset G$ be the collection of unitary equivalence classes of $n$ dimensional irreducible unitary representations of $G$. As before $\H_{n}$ is a choice of fixed Hilbert space of dimension $n$. Then, with respect to the Borel--Mackey structure, there is a canonical `locally trivial' measurable field of Hilbert spaces $\{ H_{p}\}$ sitting over $\hat{G}$. That is, $\hat{G}=\coprod_{n \leq \infty} \hat{G}_{n}$ is a partition into measurable subsets such that $\H_{p}=\H_{n}$ for $p \in \hat{G}_{n}$.
\par Further, essentially by definition, there is a measurable field of representations $\{\pi_{p}\}$ over $\hat{G}$ acting on the canonical field of Hilbert spaces $\{ H_{p}\}$ such that $\pi_{p} \in p$ for all equivalence classes $p\in \hat{G}$. One must be a little careful in showing that the choice of representatives $\pi_{p}$ can be made measurably in $p$.
\begin{thm}
	Suppose that $G$ is locally compact and type $1$, $\pi$ a unitary representation of $G$ on a separable Hilbert space, and $\H_{p}$, $\pi_{p}$ are the fields over $\hat{G}$ discussed in the preceding two paragraphs. Then there exist pairwise disjointly supported finite measures $\mu_{1},...,\mu_{\infty}$ on $\hat{G}$ such that 
		\begin{align*}
			\pi \approx \bigoplus_{n\leq \infty} n\cdot \rho_{n}
		\end{align*}
	where $n \rho_{n}$ denotes $n$ copies of $\int^{\oplus}\pi_{p}\dop \mu_{n}(p)$.
\end{thm}
%As far as I can tell, one can arrange that the measure $\mu_{n}$ is supported in $\hat{G}_{n}$. We will see how this works in the examples to follow.
\subsection{Plancherel}
Let $J^{1}=L^{1}(G)\cap L^{2}(G)$ and let $J^{2}$ be the linear span of $f*g$ for $f,g\in J^{1}$. For $f\in J^{1}$ define the Fourier transform
	\begin{align*}
		\hat{f}(\pi)=\int f(x)\pi(x^{-1})\dop x.
	\end{align*}
We think of $\hat{f}(\pi)$ as element of $\H_{\pi}\otimes \overline{\H_{\pi}}$. This is the same as viewing $\hat{f}(\pi)$ as a trace class operator on $\H_{\pi}$. Then we have the Plancherel's theorem:
	\begin{thm}
		Let $G$ be type $1$ and unimodular. Then there is a measure $\mu$ on $\hat{G}$, uniquely determined by a choice of Haar on $G$, with the following properties:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The Fourier transform maps $J^{1}$ unitarily into $\int^{\oplus}\H_{\pi}\otimes \H_{\overline{\pi}}\dop \mu$ which extends to a unitary isomorphism on $L^{2}(G)$.
			\item The Fourier transform intertwines the two sided regular representation $\tau$ with $\int^{\oplus}\pi \otimes \overline{\pi} \dop \mu(\pi)$. 
			\item For $f,g\in J^{1}$ 
				\begin{align*}
					\int_{G}f(x)\overline{g}(x)\dop x=\int_{\hat{G}}\Tr[\hat{f}(\pi) \hat{g}(\pi)^{*}] \dop \mu (\pi)
				\end{align*} 
			\item For $h\in J^{2}$ one has 
				\begin{align*}
					h(x)=\int \tr[\hat{\pi}(x)\hat{h}(\pi)] \dop \mu(\pi).
				\end{align*}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{thm}
\section{explicit examples}
In all the examples, $G$ is of type $1$. We apply the theorem to the unitary representation of $G$ on $L^{2}(G)$ acting via right translation. The output of the theorem is always a measurable field of representations $\pi_{p}$ on the canonical field of Hilbert spaces $\H_{p}$ over $\hat{G}$, along with a measure $\dop \mu$. The measure is what we'll be looking at. Further, the collection of subrepresentations (not necessarily irreducible) correspond to elements of the direct integral supported on a measurable subset of the $\hat{G}$. The \emph{irreducible} subspaces correspond to points in $\hat{G}$ with nonzero measure. 
\subsection{$L^{2}(\R)$} 
Let $G=\R$.  By Schur's lemma, any irreducible unitary representation of $G$ must be one dimensional. For each $t \in \R$, define the character $\xi_{t}: \R\mapsto \Aut(\C)=\C^{\times}$ by $\xi_{t}(x)=e^{-2\pi i x t}=:\ip{\xi_{t}}{x}$. This defines an irreducible unitary representation of $G$ on $\C$, viewed as a 1 dimensional complex vectorspace. It is classical that $\hat{G}=\set{\xi_{t}}{t\in \R}\approx \R$ where the identification is as topological groups (hence also as measure spaces). Let $\H_{t}=\C$ for all $t\in \R=\hat{G}$, and $\mu$ be the Lebesgue measure. Then for $f\in L^{1}(\R)\cap L^{2}(\R)$ define a map $U$, taking values in $\int^{\oplus}\H_{t}\dop \mu(t)$ by
	\begin{align}\label{eq:1}
		\left[Uf\right](t)=\int_{\R}\xi_{t}(x)f(x)\dop \mu(x).
	\end{align}
$U$ is unitary on $L^{2}(\R)\cap L^{1}(\R)$ and extends to a unitary isomorphism $L^{2}(\R)\to \int^{\oplus}\H_{t}\dop \mu(t)$, which we still denote by $U$.  Then for any $f\in L^{2}(\R)$,  and $t\in \R$,
	\begin{align*}
		[UR_{y}f][(t)= \int^{\oplus}\xi_{t}(y)\left[Uf\right](t)\dop \mu (t) =\left[ \xi_{t}(y)Uf](t)\right]= e^{2\pi i t y}\left[Uf\right](t).
	\end{align*}
\par With respect to the Lebesgue measure, all points in $\hat{G}$ have measure zero, which is one explanation for why $L^{2}(\R)$ has no \emph{irreducible} subrepresentations. The non-irreducible subrepresentations are all of the form $U^{-1}\int^{\oplus}_{E}\H_{t}\dop \mu (t)=\set{f\in L^{2}(\R)}{Uf \text{ is supported on $E$}}$ where $E\subset \R$ is measurable. One should think about why the sequence of representations $U^{-1}\int^{\oplus}_{(-1/n,1/n)}\H_{t}\dop \mu (t)$ does not `converge' in any meaningful sense.
\subsection{$L^{2}(\R/\Z)$}
We'll look at $L^{2}(\R/\Z)$ as a unitary representation in two different ways. First, $\R/\Z$ is itself a compact abelian group, so the theorem applies to decompose $L^{2}(\R/\Z)$ with respect to unitary irreps of $\R/\Z$. Second, $\R$ acts on $\R/\Z$ by translation, which induces a unitary action of $\R$ on $L^{2}(\R/\Z)$. The theorem applies here too.
\par All irreducible finite dimensional unitary reps of $\R/\Z$ are $1$ dimensional. Take a smooth function $f\in L^{2}(\R/\Z)$ and identify it with a smooth $\Z$ periodic function on $\R$ which we still call $f$. Then observe that for any $x\in \R$ $\Delta f(x+t)=\left[\Delta f\right] (x+t)$ for each $t\in \R$, where $\Delta= d^{2}/dx^{2}$ is the one dimensional Laplacian. Since $\Delta$ commutes with translation, it stabilizes the irreducible subrepresentations. Since those subspaces are $1$-dimensional, they must be eigenspaces for $\Delta$. Integration by parts twice, on $\R/\Z$, shows that eigenvalues must be nonpositive real. That is to say, if $f$ spans an irreducible subrepresentation for $\R/\Z$ in $L^{2}(\R/\Z)$ then its lift to $\R$ must satisfy the following ordinary differential equation with initial conditions 
	\begin{align*}
		f''=-\lambda^{2} f \quad \text{ for some $\lambda^{2} \in \R$,} \qquad f(0)=f(1).
	\end{align*}
All solutions to the differential equation on $\R$ are of the form $f(x)=e^{\pm i\lambda x}$, and the initial condition forces $e^{\pm i \lambda}=1$, so $\lambda \in 2\pi i \Z$. If $\lambda=2\pi i n \neq 0$ then $\xi_{n}(x)=e^{2\pi i n x}$ is an eigenfunction and spans an irreducible representation. If $\lambda = 0$ then $f$ satisfies the differential equation $f''=0$ which means $f'$ is constant. The only smooth periodic function $f$ such that $f'$ is constant is itself a constant function. We have shown that $\{ [\xi_{n}]: n\in \Z\} \subset \hat{\R/\Z}$. To show  the opposite containment, use the fact that any unitary rep of an abelian group acts as a unitary character. Thus $\hat{\R/\Z}$ is in bijection with $\Z$ and we'll take for granted that this is actually an isomorphism of topological groups. L:et $\H_{n}=\C$ for all $n\in \hat{\R/\Z}=\Z$  and let $\eta$ denote the counting measure. Then for $f\in L^{2}$, define an operator $U: L^{2}(\R/\Z)\to \int^{\oplus}_{\Z} \H_{n}\dop \eta (n)=\bigoplus_{n\in \Z} \H_{n}$ (Hilbert space direct sum) by
	\begin{align*}
		\left[Uf\right](n)=\int_{\R/\Z}\xi_{n}(x)f(x)\dop \eta (x).
	\end{align*}
Then for any $f\in L^{2}(\R/\Z)$ and $y\in \R/\Z$ we have
	\begin{align*}
		[U R_{y}f](n)=\xi_{n}(x)\left[Uf\right](n).
	\end{align*}
\par With respect to the counting measure all points in $\hat{G}$ have measure one, so all irreducible finite dimensional unitary representations of $G$ appear in $L^{2}(\R/\Z)$ as direct summands. All subrepresentations can be obtained as (Hilbert space) direct sums of irreducibles. 
\par Now we look at $L^{2}(\R/\Z)$ as a unitary representation of $\R$. The parameter space in the direct integral decomposition $\int_{\R}^{\oplus}\H_{t}\dop \eta$ remains $\R$, but the measure $\dop \eta$ will not be Lebesgue. Instead, it must be supported on the representations $\xi_{t}$ which are invariant under translation by the subgroup $\Z$. That is, $\xi_{t}(x+1)=\xi_{t}(x)$ for all $x\in \R$. This is to say that $e^{2\pi i t(1+x)}=e^{2\pi i tx}$, whence we recover $t=n\in \Z$. Let $\eta$ be the counting measure on this copy of $\Z\subset \R =\hat{G}$. The definition of our operator $U$ is identical to that in equation (\ref{eq:1}), with $\dop \eta$ replacing $\dop \mu$. Now lets look at the $0$ element of the direct integral. It is an equivalence class:
	\begin{align*}
				0=\set{f:\R \to \C}{\int_{\R}|f(x)|^{2} \dop \eta(x)=0}.
	\end{align*}
These are precisely the functions supported away from $\Z$. Thus each class in $\int^{\oplus}_{\R}\H_{t}\dop \eta(t)$ has exactly one representative supported on $\Z$. This provides the bijection between this decomposition and the preceding.
\par Note: The second example is the one which will apply to the decomposition of $L^{2}(G(\Q)\setminus G(\mathbb{A}))$ as a unitary rep of $G(\mathbb{A})$. The key point is that looking at functions on a \emph{quotient} of $G$ corresponds to a measure supported on a \emph{subspace} of $\hat{G}$.  
%\subsection{$L^{2}(H_{n})$}
%The underlying space of the Heisenberg group $H_{n}$ is $\R^{n}\times \R^{n}\times \R$, and the group law is 
%	\begin{align*}
%		(x,\xi,t)(x',\xi',t')=(x+x',\xi+\xi', t+t'+\frac{1}{2}(x\cdot \xi'+\xi\cdot x'))
%	\end{align*}
%where $\cdot$ denotes the euclidean inner product. One can realize $H_{n}$ as a matrix group via the embedding
%	\begin{align*}
%		  \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 
%    1 & x & t \\ 
%     & \operatorname{id}_{n\times n} & \xi^{\top} \\ 
%     &  & 1 \\ 
%  \end{array}\right).
%	\end{align*}
%This is a nilpotent Lie group of dimension $2n+1$. Thus the exponential map $\operatorname{Lie}(H)=\h \to H$ is a diffeomorphism. The Lie bracket is given by 
%	\begin{align*}
%		[(x,\xi,t),(x',\xi',t')]=(0,0, x\cdot \xi'+\xi\cdot x'). 
%	\end{align*}
%We will make use of the following theorem of Kirillov:
%\begin{thm}
%	Let $G$ be a simply connected nilpotent Lie group, $\g=\operatorname{Lie}(g)$. Fix $\lambda \in \g^{*}$ and let $\h$ be a maximal subalgebra of $\g$ such that $\lambda|_{[\h,\h]}=0$. Let $H$ be the unique subgroup of $G$ such that $\exp \h = H$. Define a character on $H$ by $\sigma_{\lambda}(\exp X)=e^{2\pi i \lambda(X)} $ for all $X\in \h$. Then the unitarily induced representation $\ind_{H}^{G}(\sigma_{\lambda})$ is irreducible, and its equivalence class is invariant under the  the co-adjoint action of $G$ on $\g$ (that is, $\ind_{H}^{G}(\sigma_{\lambda})\approx \ind_{H}^{G}(\sigma_{\operatorname{Ad}(g^{-1})^{*}\lambda})$  for all $g\in G$.). The map $[\lambda] \to [\ind_{H}^{G}(\sigma_{\lambda})]$ taking co-adjoint orbits to $\hat{G}$ is a homeomorphism, where the source has the quotient topology and the target has the Fell topology. 
%\end{thm}
%The co-adjoint action of $H_{n}$ on $\h$ is given by
%	\begin{align*}
%		[\operatorname{Ad}^{*}(x,\xi,t)](b,\beta,r)=(b+rx,\beta-r\xi,r).
%	\end{align*}
%Fix $(b,\beta,r)$. If $r=h\neq0$ then letting $x,\xi$ vary through $\R^{n}$, we see that the orbit of $(b,\beta,r)$ is the hyperplane $r=h$. If $r=0$, then $(b,\beta,r)$ is co-adjoint invariant, so its orbit is the singleton $\{(b,\beta,0)\}$. Thus, $\hat{G}=\R^{n}\times \R^{n}\times \R / \sim$, where $(b,\beta,r)\sim(b',\beta',r')$ when either $r=r'\neq 0$ or $r=r'=0$ and $(b,\beta)=(b',\beta')$. As a set, this is in bijection with $\R^{\times} \cup \R^{n}\times \R^{n}$, though they are not homeomorphic (when the latter has the subspace topology of $\R^{2n+1}$). Indeed, take two points in $\R^{n}\times \R^{n}$ and look at open balls about these points in $\R^{n}\times \R^{n}\times$, they intersect with some common hyperplane $r=h\neq 0$ so their projections both contain the point $(\cdot,\cdot, r)$. Thus, such points cannot be separated: $\hat{G}$ is not Hausdorff. 
%
%Let $N_{1}=\set{(x,\xi,t)\in H_{n}}{x=0}$, an abelian subgroup. Define a one dimensional representation of $N_{1}$ by the untiary character $\chi_{h}(0,\xi,t)=e^{2\pi i h t}$. Let $\rho_{h}=\ind_{N_{1}}^{H_{n}}(\chi_{h})$. This is unitarily equivalent to the subspace of $L^{2}(\R)$ transforming according to 
%	\begin{align*}
%		\left[\rho_{h}(x,\xi,t)f\right](y)=e^{\pi i h(2t+ \xi\cdot x-2\xi \cdot y) }f(y-x). 
%	\end{align*} 
%A corollary to the proof of the \emph{Stone--von Neumann} theorem shows that $\rho_{h}$ is irreducible. These are the representations corresponding to the hyperplanes $r=h \neq 0$.
%
%The representations corresponding to the singletons $\{(b,\beta,0)\}$ are one dimensional, acting by the character $\pi_{b,\beta}(x,\xi,t)=e^{2\pi i (b\cdot x+\beta \cdot \xi}$. 
\subsection{$L^{2}(\SL_{2}(\R))$}
 Let $G=\SL_{2}(\R)$ and define subgroups
	 \begin{align*}
		A&=\set{a_{t}=\Tbt{e^{t}}{0}{0}{e^{-t}}}{t \in \R} \\
		N&=\set{N_{x}=\Tbt{1}{x}{0}{1}}{x\in \R}, \\
		K&=\set{r_{\theta}=\Tbt{\cos \theta}{-\sin \theta}{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}}{\theta \in [0,2\pi)} \\
		P&=AN
	\end{align*}
The following is an exhaustive non-redundant list of irreducible unitary reps of $G$
\begin{itemize}
	\item The trivial representation,
	\item The discrete series, $\delta^{\pm}_{n}$ ($n\geq 2$). Let $H^{+}_{n}$ be the collection of holomorphic $f$ on the  upper half plane $\h$ equipped with the norm $|f|_{n}^{2}=\int_{h}|f(x+iy)|^{2}y^{n}\frac{\dop x \dop y}{y^{2}}$. Define the representation by
		\begin{align*}
			\delta_{n}^{+}\Tbt{a}{b}{c}{d}f(\tau)=(cz+d)^{-n}f(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}).
		\end{align*} 
	The action $\delta^{-}_{n}$ is the same as $\delta^{+}_{n}$, but is on the space of \emph{anti}-holomorphic functions.
	\item The mock discrete series (or limit of discrete series): Let $H^{\pm}_{1}$ be the space of holomorphic (resp. antiholomorphic) functions on $\h$ such that 
	\begin{align*}
		|f|^{2}_{1}=\sup_{y>0}\int_{\R}|f(x+iy)|^{2}\dop x<\infty.
	\end{align*}
The representation is defined by the formula above. 
	\item The unramified spherical principal series: for $s\geq 0$ define a character $\chi_{t}$ on $P$ by $\chi_{s}(a_{t}n_{x})=|e^{t}|^{is}$ and let $\pi_{is}=\ind_{P}^{G}(\chi_{s})$. 
	\item The aspherical principal series: same as before, but $s>0$ and $\chi_{s}$ is twisted by the sign character. 
	\item The complementary series: for $s\in(0,1)$ let the space of $k_{s}$ be all $f:\R\to \C$ so that 
	\begin{align*}
		|f|_{s}^{2}=s/2 \int f(x)\overline{f}(y)|x-y|^{s-1}\dop x \dop y<\infty	
	\end{align*}
	and define the action 
	\begin{align*}
		k_{s}\Tbt{a}{b}{c}{d}f(x)=|cx+d|^{-1-s}f(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}). 
	\end{align*}
\end{itemize} 
So
	\begin{align*}
		\hat{G}=\{1\}\cup \{ \delta^{\pm}_{n}:n\geq 1\}\cup \{ \pi_{is}^{+}:s\geq0\} \cup \{ \pi^{-}_{is}: s>0\} \cup \{k_{s}: 0<s<1\}.
	\end{align*}
The plancherel measure is given by 
	\begin{align*}
		\dop \mu(\pi_{it}^{+})&=\frac{t}{2}\tanh \frac{\pi t}{2} \dop t \\
		\dop \mu(\pi_{it}^{-})&=\frac{t}{2}\coth\frac{\pi t}{2} \dop t\\
		\dop \mu(\delta^{+}_{n})&=\dop \mu( \delta^{-}_{n})=n-1.
	\end{align*}
	
%The Iwasawa decomposition shows that $G=NAK,$ and in fact the map $(n_{x},a_{t},r_{\theta}) \mapsto   n_{x}a_{t}r_{\theta}$ is a homeomorphism $N\times A \times K \to G$.
%
%For $\lambda \in \C$ define a character on $A$ by $\chi_{\lambda}(a_{t})=e^{t(2\lambda+1)}$ and extend $\chi_{\lambda}$ to $P$ (the only way to do this is by letting $\chi_{\lambda}|_{N}=1$.) Set
%	\begin{align*}
%		V_{\lambda}=\ind_{P}^{G}(\chi_{\lambda})=\set{f:G\to \C}{f(\pm a_{t}n_{x} g)=\chi_{\lambda}(a_{t}n)f(g), \quad f|_{K}\in L^{2}(K)},
%	\end{align*}
%equipped with the inner product 
%	\begin{align*}
%		\ip{f}{\phi}=\int_{K}f(k)\overline{\phi}{k}\dop k. 
%	\end{align*}
%Call the right regular action restricted to this space $\pi_{\lambda}$. One can compute that $\pi_{\lambda}$ is unitary with respect to this inner product if and only if $\lambda \in i\R$.

\title{Secret seminar talk: Real quadratic zetas and periods of Eisenstein series}
\author{Justin Katz}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Arithmetic side}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let $D$ be square free, for convenience $D=2,3 \mod 4$. Let $k=\Q(\sqrt{D})$ and $\Of_{k}=\Z[\sqrt{D}]$.
	\item The norm map $N:k\to \Q$ is given by $N(a+b\sqrt{D})=(a+b\sqrt{D})(a-b\sqrt{D})=a^{2}-Db^{2}$. 
	\item Let $I$ be the collection of integral ideals of $\Of_{k}$ and define
		\begin{align*}
			\zeta_{k}(s)=\sum_{\a \in I/\{0\}}|N(\a)|^{-s} \quad \text{ $\re s>1$}
		\end{align*}
	\item Let $C_{k}$ be the class group (which is finite), and let $\a_{1},..,\a_{h}$ be integral representatives of each ideal class.
	\item $\zeta_{k}$ breaks up 
		\begin{align*}
			\zeta_{k}(s)=\sum_{i=1}^{h}\sum_{\b \in [\a_{i}]}|N(\b)|^{-s}.
		\end{align*}
	\item $\b \in [\a_{i}]$ if and only if $\b=\theta \a_{i}$ for some $\theta \in \a_{i}^{-1}=\{\theta: \theta \a_{i} \subset \Of_{k}\}$, so 
		\begin{align*}
			\zeta_{k}(s)=\sum_{i=1}^{h}\sum_{\theta \in \a^{-1}_{i}}|N(\theta \a_{i})|^{-s}.
		\end{align*}
	\item Pick a $\Z$ basis $e_{1},e_{2}$ for $\a_{i}^{-1}$
		\begin{align*}
			\zeta_{k}(s)=\sum_{i=1}^{h}\sum_{(m,n) \in \Z^{2}/ \{0\}}|N((me_{1}+ne_{2})\a_{i})|^{-s}.
		\end{align*}
	\item By algebraic number theory, there are integers $A_{i},B_{i},C_{i}$ with $\disc Q_{i} = B_{i}^{2}-4A_{i}C_{i}=d$ and
		\begin{align*}
			N((me_{1}+ne_{2})\a_{i})=A_{i}m^{2}+B_{i}mn+C_{i}n^{2}=Q_{i}(m,n).
		\end{align*}
	\item Thus,
		\begin{align*}
			\zeta_{k}(s)=\sum_{i=1}^{h}\sum_{(m,n) \in \Z^{2}/ \{0\}}|Q_{i}(m,n)|^{-s}
		\end{align*} 
	\item Changing basis in the lattice of $\a_{i}^{-1}$  amounts to the action of $\SL_{2}(\Z)$ on $Q_{i}$, and by theory of quadratic forms, merely permutes the terms in the sum. 
\end{itemize}
\section{Geometro-analytic side}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To analyze the Dedekind zeta, we bring the geometry of the moduli space of lattices to bear on it. 
	\item Define a group and its subgroup, using convention that subscripts denote domain of entries
		\begin{align*}
			G=\SL_{2}, \quad P= \tbt{*}{*}{0}{*}.
		\end{align*}
	\item $G_{\R}$ and its subgroups act on the complex upper half plane $\half=\{z:\im z>0\}$ by linear fractional transformations
		\begin{align*}
			\tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} \tau = \frac{a \tau +b}{c\tau +d}
		\end{align*}
	\item (Aux. useful computation) 
		\begin{align*}
			 \im \tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} \tau= \frac{\im \tau}{ |c \tau +d|^{2}}
		\end{align*} 
	\item Aside: If $\half$ is endowed with the hyperbolic metric, $G_{\R}$ acts by isometries. 
	\item Action is transitive, isotropy of $i$ is $K=\SO(2)$: 
		\begin{align*}
			\tbt {a}{b}{c}{d} i= i \iff ai+b=-c + id  \iff a=d, \quad b=-c, \quad a^{2}+b^{2}=1
		\end{align*}
	\item By orbit stabilizer theorem
		\begin{align*}
			G_{\R}/K \approx \half  \quad \text{ via } \quad  gK \mapsto gi. 
		\end{align*}
	\item The moduli space of lattices is given by $G_{\Z} \setminus \half \approx G_{\Z} \setminus G_{\R} / K$
	\item The Real analytic Eisenstein series are functions either on $\half$ or $G_{\R}$ designed to descend to these quotients: 
		\begin{align*}
			E_{s}(g)&= \sum_{\gamma \in P_{\Z} \setminus G_{\Z} } (\im(\gamma g i))^{s}   \quad \text{ $\re(s)>1$}\\ 
			\text{ or }E_{s}(z)&= \sum_{\gamma \in P_{\Z}\setminus G_{\Z}}(\im(\gamma z))^{s} \\
						  &= \sum_{\tbt{*}{*}{c}{d} \in G_{\Z} }  \frac{(\im z)^{s}}{2|cz+d|^{2s}} 
		\end{align*}
	\item (Note, being in $G_{\Z}$ forces $(c,d)=1$)
	\item Convenient modification: a sum over all $(c,d)\neq 0$, can be written as $\sum_{e=1}^{\infty}\sum_{(c,d)=e}$. Upon multiplication by $\zeta(2s)$ we thus have
		\begin{align*}
			\zeta(2s)E_{s}(z)=\sum_{(c,d) \neq 0} \frac{(\im z)^{s}}{2|cz+d|^{2s}}
		\end{align*} 
\end{itemize}
\section{$D<0$ easy}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For imaginary quadratic, $D<0$ we've just shown that the Dedekind zeta breaks into a sum of a definite quadratic form at lattice points. 
	\item Erstwhile, 
		\begin{align*}
			|cz+d|^{2} & = (c\re(z)+d)^{2}+\im( z)^{2}c^{2}  \\
							 & =  |z|^{2}c^{2}+2\re(z) cd+d^{2}
		\end{align*}
		is a quadratic form of discriminant $4(\re z)^{2}-4|z|^{2}=-4 (\im z)^{2} $. 
	\item  By reduction theory, for each imaginary quadratic ideal class, with corresponding quadratic form $Q_{i}$  there is a unique $z_{i}$ in the standard fundamental domain $G_{\Z}\setminus \half$ with $\frac{\im z}{|mz+n|^{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{D}/2}{Q_{i}(c,d)}$.
	\item This gives 
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{(\sqrt{D}/2)^{s}}{\zeta(2s)} \zeta_{k}(s)= \sum_{i=1}^{h} E_{s}(z_{i}).
		\end{align*} 
\end{itemize}
\section{$D>0$ preparations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For real quadratic, $D>0$ the quadratic forms $Q_{i}$ are \emph{indefinite}. There is no hope of finding $z_{i}$ to make the above work. 
	\item Instead, approach from the geometric side. There is a canonical embedding $\i:k^{*}\to \GL_{\Q}(k)$ via multiplication.
	\item With basis $1,\sqrt{D}$,  the embedding is 
		\begin{align*}
			a+b\sqrt{D} \mapsto\Tbt{a}{bD}{b}{a}.
		\end{align*}
	\item Dirichlet's theorem on units shows that the intersection $H_{\Z}=\i(k^{*})\cap G_{\Z}$ is nontrivial. This subgroup corresponds to $\i({\Of^{\times}_{k}}_{>0})$, positive normed units.
	\item $H_{\Z}$ is a subgroup of $H_{\R}=H_{\Z}\otimes \R$, a one parameter subgroup which is easy to describe
		\begin{align*}
			H_{\R}=\{ \Tbt{a}{bD}{b}{a}: a^{2}-b^{2}D=1\} = \{ h(t)=\Tbt{\cosh t}{ \sinh t \sqrt{D}}{\sinh t/\sqrt{D}}{\cosh t} : t\in \R\} 
		\end{align*}
	\item For any nonidentity $h=\tbt{a}{bD}{b}{a} \in H_{\Z}$,  $\Tr(h)=2a>2$ (since $a^{2}=1+b^{2}D$ if $b^{2}\neq 0$ then $a^{2}\geq 1+D$ and one can check for $D=2,3$ that always $2a>2$.) 
	\item That is, nontrivial units in ${\Of^{\times}_{k}}_{>0}$ correspond to hyperbolic transformations.
	\item Hyperbolic transformations have $2$ distinct real fixed points, one acting as a sink, the other as a source. 
	\item For $a+b\sqrt{D} \mapsto h H_{\Z}$, the fixed points of $h$ are its eigenvalues, which are the conjugates $a\pm b \sqrt{D}$.
	\item The group $H_{\R}$ acts freely and transitively on the geodesic from $a\pm b \sqrt{D}$, and by the existence of nontrivial units $H_{\Z} \setminus H_{\R}$ is closed (hence compact).
	\subsection{Computation for the quadratic form $a^{2}-Db^{2}$}
		\item The quadratic form corresponding to the trivial class is just the norm $a^{2}-Db^{2}$. Dehomogenizing, we have the quadratic polynomial $a^{2}-D=0$, with roots $a=\pm \sqrt{D}$. Let $C_{1}$ be the geodesic joining $\pm \sqrt{D}$.
		\item $i\sqrt{D}$ is on this geodesic, so
			\begin{align*}
				C_{1}= \{ h(t)\cdot i\sqrt{D} = \sqrt{D}\frac{i \cosh t+ \sinh t}{i \sinh t+\cosh t}: t\in \R\}. 
			\end{align*} 
		\item The integral to compute is then $\int_{\R} E_{s}(\sqrt{D}\frac{i \cosh t+ \sinh t}{i \sinh t+\cosh t}) \dop t $
			\begin{align*}
																	&= \int_{H_{\Z}\sm H_{\R}} E_{s}(h  i \sqrt{D}) \dop h \\
																	&= \int_{H_{\Z}\sm H_{\R}} \sum_{\gamma \in P_{\Z}\sm G_{\Z}}\im(\gamma h i \sqrt{D})^{s}\dop h \\
																	&= \int_{H_{\Z}\sm H_{\R}} \sum_{a \in P_{\Z}\sm G_{\Z}/H_{\Z}} \sum_{b \in a P_{\Z} a^{-1} \cap H_{z} \sm H_{\Z}} \im(ab h i\sqrt{D})^{s}\dop h  \\
																	&=\sum_{a \in P_{\Z}\sm G_{\Z}/H_{\Z}}  \int_{H_{\Z}\sm H_{\R}} \sum_{b \in \pm 1 \sm H_{\Z}} \im(ab h i\sqrt{D})^{s}\dop h  \\
																	&=\sum_{a \in P_{\Z}\sm G_{\Z}/H_{\Z}}  \int_{\pm 1 \sm H_{\R}}  \im(a h i\sqrt{D})^{s}\dop h  \\

%\section{The desired computation}
%Let $G$ be a unimodular locally compact group, $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup, and $R$ be the right regular representation of $G$ on $L^{2}(\Gamma \lmod G)$. Convert the group representation $R$ to an algebra representation of $C_{c}(G)$, still called $R$, by 
%	\begin{align*}
%		(R(f)\phi)(x)=\int_{G}f(y)\phi(xy)\dop y.
%	\end{align*}
%In situations where it is sensible, the following computation `winds up' this integral along $\Gamma$:
%	\begin{align*}
%		(R(f)\phi)(x)&= \int_{G}f(y)\phi(xy)\dop y \\
%				&= \int_{G}f(x^{-1}y)\phi(y)\dop y \\
%				&=\int_{\Gamma \lmod G}\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}f(x^{-1}\gamma y)\phi(\gamma y)\dop y \\
%				&=\int_{\Gamma \lmod G}\left (\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma}f(x^{-1}\gamma y)\right ) \phi(y) \dop y,
%	\end{align*}
%where we've used $\Gamma$ invariance of $\phi$ (not $f$!) in the last step. The sum appearing in the last integrand manifests a kernel defining $R(f)$. Set
%	\begin{align*}
%		K_{f}(x,y)=\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma}f(x^{-1}\gamma y).
%	\end{align*}
%Then, on the one hand, the trace of $R(f)$ is 
%	\begin{align*}
%		\Tr R(f)=\int_{\Gamma\lmod G} K_{f}(x,x)\dop x. 
%	\end{align*}
%Now, denote the set of conjugacy classes of elements in $\Gamma$ by $\{\Gamma\}$, and for a class $\gamma$ in $\{\Gamma\}$  denote the centralizers of $\gamma$ in $\Gamma$ and $G$ respectively by:
%	\begin{align*}
%		\Gamma_{\gamma}&=\{ g\in \Gamma: g^{-1}\gamma g =\gamma\} \\
%		G_{\gamma}&=\{g \in G:g^{-1}\gamma g= \gamma\}.
%	\end{align*}
%Now note that the set orbits of $\Gamma$ acting on itself by conjugation is precisely $\{\Gamma\},$ and the stabilizer of an element in an orbit $\gamma$ is $\Gamma_{\gamma}$.  Orbit stabilizer affords us the decomposition of $\Gamma$ (abusing notation, conflating classes and elements)
%	 \begin{align*}
%		\Gamma&=\bigcup_{\gamma \in \{\Gamma\}}\bigcup_{g \in \Gamma_{\gamma}\lmod \Gamma} \{ \delta \gamma \delta^{-1}\}
%	\end{align*}
%which manifests in the sum 
%	\begin{align*}
%		\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} f(x\gamma x^{-1}) = \sum_{\gamma \in \{\Gamma\}} \sum_{g\in \Gamma_{\gamma}\lmod \Gamma} f(xg \gamma g^{-1} x^{-1}).
%	\end{align*}
% pass the sum over $\{\Gamma\}$ through the integral, and then `wind' $\Gamma \lmod G$ along $\Gamma_{\gamma} \lmod \Gamma$ to obtain
%	\begin{align*}
%		\Tr(R(f))&= \sum_{\gamma \in \{\Gamma\}}\sum_{g\in \Gamma_{\gamma}\lmod\Gamma}f(x^{-1}g^{-1}\gamma gx) \\
%			&=\sum_{\gamma \in \{\Gamma\}}  \sum_{\Gamma_{g}\lmod G} f(x^{-1}\gamma x) \dop x.
%	\end{align*}
%As a last refinement, wind $\Gamma_{\gamma}\lmod G$ along $\Gamma_{\gamma}\lmod G_{\gamma}$ to obtain 
%	\begin{align*}
%				\Tr(R(f)) &=  \sum_{\gamma \in \{\Gamma\}}\vol(\Gamma_{\gamma}\lmod G_{\gamma}) \int_{G_{\gamma}\lmod G}f(x^{-1}\gamma x)\dop x.
%	\end{align*}
\1
%Now, if as a $G$ rep (and thereby as a $C_{c}(G)$ rep,) we have a decomposition 
%	\begin{align*}
%		L^{2}(\Gamma \lmod G) = \bigoplus_{\pi \in \hat{G}} m_{\pi}^{\Gamma} \pi,  \qquad \text{where $m_{\pi}^{\Gamma}=\dim(\hom_{G}(\pi,L^{2}(\Gamma\lmod G)))$},
%	\end{align*}
%	and on the other hand, 
%		\begin{align*}
%			\Tr R(f)= \sum_{\pi \in \hat{G}} m_{\pi}\Tr \pi(f).
%		\end{align*}
%The trace formula is the equality of these two expressions. 
%
%Note, there are many things that are potentially nonsense here: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%	 \item Is the operator $R(f)$ of trace class? 
%	 \item Are the passages of sums through integrals sensible?
%	 \item Does $L^{2}(\Gamma  \lmod G)$ have such a decomposition? Need the multiplicities be finite? Are the irreducibles finite dimensional? If not, is $\pi(f)$ trace class on $\pi$?
%\end{enumerate}
%\section{Situations where it works, no problem: 1--Finite groups}
%Suppose $G$ is finite. Then any $\Gamma \leq G$ is discrete. Haar measure on $G$ and $\Gamma$ is counting, so integrals are merely sums over group elements. Note, in this case, that the space $L^{2}(\Gamma \lmod G)$ is finite dimensional and consists of (all) left $\Gamma$ invariant functions on $G$. This coincides with the representation induced from the trivial one on $\Gamma$.
%
%All sums being finite, and spaces finite dimensional, the discussion in section 1 applies with no stipulations. This gives us a formula
%	\begin{align*}
%		\sum_{\pi \in \hat{G}} m_{\pi}^{\Gamma}\Tr(\pi(f)) = \Tr R(f)= \sum_{\gamma \in \{\Gamma\}}\left |\Gamma_{\gamma}\lmod G_{\gamma}\right| \sum_{x \in G_{\gamma}\lmod G}f(x^{-1}\gamma x).
%	\end{align*}
%
%An application:
%\begin{thm}For an irreducible  $\pi$ of $G$, 
%	\begin{align*}
%		\dim_{\C}\hom_{G}(\pi,L^{2}(\Gamma \lmod G))=\dim_{\C}(\hom_{\Gamma}(1,\pi))
%	\end{align*}
%\end{thm}
%\begin{proof}
%Fix an irreducible $\sigma$ of $G$ and apply the trace formula to $f_{\sigma}g\mapsto \overline{\Tr(\sigma(g))}$, the (conjugate) character of $\sigma$. The operators $\pi(\overline{\Tr(\sigma)})$ appearing on the LHS act as
%	\begin{align*}
%		v\mapsto \sum_{g\in G}\overline{\Tr(\sigma)}(g)\pi(g)v.
%	\end{align*}
%By orthogonality (and linearity!) of characters, the trace of this operator is $0$ unless $\pi=\sigma$ and $|G|$ otherwise. 
%
%To attack the RHS, recall that characters are conjugacy invariant, so for each conjugacy class $\gamma$
%	\begin{align*}
%		\sum_{x\in G_{\gamma}\lmod G}\Tr(\sigma(x^{-1}\gamma x))&= \left| G_{\gamma} \lmod G \right| \overline{\Tr(\sigma(\gamma ))}.
%	\end{align*}
%Now the RHS is 
%	\begin{align*}
%		\Tr(f_{\sigma})&=\sum_{\gamma \in \{\Gamma\}} \left | \Gamma_{\gamma}\lmod G_{\gamma} \right | \left | G_{\gamma} \lmod G \right| \overline{\Tr \sigma (\gamma)} \\
%				&=|G| \overline{\sum_{\gamma\in \{\Gamma\}}1/|\Gamma_{\gamma}| \Tr(\sigma(\gamma))} \\
%			        &=|G| \dim \hom_{\Gamma}(1,\sigma)
%	\end{align*}
%\end{proof}
%\section{Situations where it works, with some effort: Compact Quotients}
%%Now using the discreteness of $\Gamma$ and the compact support of $f$ to conclude that the sum defining $K_{f}$ is locally finite, we
%Functional analytic preliminaries:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Compact operator means image of ball is precompact
%\item Equiv, compact means limit of finiite rNAK operators
%\item Collection of compact operators is closed in norm topology
%\item Take $A$ bounded on $H$. If for some orthonormal basis $B$, the sum $\sum_{b \in B}|Ab|^{2}$ is finite, then its value is independent of the orthonormal basis. Call such an operator \emph{Hilbert--Schmidt}. Proof: Take another basis $B'$ and write $Ab=\sum_{b' \in B'}\ip{Ab}{b'}b'$ then by orthonormality $|Ab|^{2}=\sum_{b' \in B'}|\ip{Ab}{b'}|^{2}$. Then
%	\begin{align*}
%		\sum_{b\in B} |Ab|^{2}&=\sum_{b\in B}\sum_{b'\in B'}|\ip{Ab}{b'}|^{2} \\
%						&=\sum_{b\in B}\sum_{b'\in B'}|\ip{b}{A^{*}b'}|^{2}\\ 
%	\end{align*}
%Switch the sums, note that $|A|_{2}=|A^{*}|_{2}$ and we're done.
%\item Hilbert-Schmidt operators are compact. Proof: manifest them as limit of finite rNAK operators-- Since the sum $\sum |Ae_{i}|^{2}$ converges, for any $n$ there is an $N_{n}$ with $\sum_{i>N_{n}}Ae_{i}<1/n^{2}$. So define $A_{n}$ as the projection of $A$ onto the space spanned by the first $N_{n}$ basis vectors.  
%\item Say that $A$ is \emph{of trace class} if for every orthonormal basis, the sum 
%	\begin{align*}
%		\sum_{b\in B}|\ip{Ab}{b} 
%	\end{align*}
%converges.  (Note, the requirement that this converge for every ONB is not vacuous. Delicate: if of trace class, then sum is absolutely convergent and independent of basis. If not of trace class, could be finite for some bases but not others). Define the trace of a trace class operator as that sum. 
%\item Trace class implies Hilbert Schmidt
%\item A product of Hilbert-Schmidt's is trace class. Proof: Use adjoint and cauchy schwarz.  
%\item $|\Tr(AB)|\leq |A||B|$
%\item If $A$ of trace class, then so is $A^{*}$ w/ $\Tr A^{*}=\overline{\Tr A}$. 
%\item An operator defined by an $L^{2}$ kernel is Hilbert--Schmidt
%\end{enumerate}
%RHS justifications:
%Since $R$ is a convolution homomorphism, the operator $R(f)$ defined by a function $f=f_{1}*f_{2}\in C_{c}(G)*C_{c}(G)\leq L^{2}(G)\times L^{2}(G)$,   is a product of Hilbert--Schmidt operators, and thus is trace class. A straightforward computation shows that, in fact, the integral kernel of the product is the product of integral kernels, in the sense that 
%	\begin{align*}
%		K_{f}(x,y)=\int_{G}K_{f_{1}}(x,z)K_{f_{2}}(z,y)\dop z. 
%	\end{align*}
%So, for such $f$, the RHS computations are justified.
%	\begin{remark}
%		For $G$ a Lie group, or adelic points of a reductive group, then any $C^{\infty}_{c}$ function is a finite sum of convolutions of $C_{c}$ functions. 
%	\end{remark}
%To justify the LHS, we need more functional analytic preliminaries:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Compact self adjoint operators on a Hilbertspace have a nonzero eigenspace, and its dimension is finite. Proof: First, establish $|A|=\sup_{|v|=1}||\ip{Av}{v}|$. Then take a sequence $v_{n}$ of unit vectors such that $|\ip{ A v_{n}}{v_{n}}=|A|$. Pass to a subseq	uence to attain convergence to real $\alpha$ with $|\alpha|=|A|$.  Use compactness of $A$ to pass to subsequence so that $Av_{n}\to v$. Then compute 
%	\begin{align*}
%		|Av_{n}-\alpha v_{n}|^{2}&=|Av_{n}|^{2}-2\alpha \ip{Av_{n}}{v_{n}}+\alpha^{2}|v_{n}|^{2}\\
%							&\leq |A|^{2}-2\alpha \ip{Av_{n}}{v_{n}}+\alpha^{2}|v_{n}|^{2}\\
%							&=\alpha^{2}-2\alpha \ip{Av_{n}}{v_{n}}+\alpha^{2}|v_{n}|^{2}\to 0. 
%	\end{align*}
%Thus, $Av_{n}\to \alpha v_{n}$, but also $Av_{n}\to v$ so $v_{n}\to v/\alpha$. 
%	\item By induction, $A$ breaks its space into a direct some of eigenspaces, each with finite dimension. 
%	\item If $A$ is a product of Hilbert--Schmidt operators, hence of trace class, then 
%		\begin{align*}
%			\Tr A=\sum_{\lambda\in \spec A} (\dim H(\lambda))\lambda.
%		\end{align*}
%	\item IOU
%\end{enumerate}
%LHS holds
%
%Example: Poisson summation 
%
%Set $G=\R$ and $\Gamma=\Z$. For each integer $n$ define $\chi_{n}:x \mapsto e^{2\pi i n x}$. Then as $\R$ representations,
%	\begin{align*}
%		L^{2}(\Z\lmod \R)=\bigoplus_{n\in \Z}\C \chi_{n}. 
%	\end{align*}
%For $f$ smooth of compact support on $\R$, LHS gives
%	\begin{align*}
%		\Tr R(f)= \sum_{n} \Tr \chi_{n}(f)
%	\end{align*}
%where 
%	\begin{align*}
%		\chi_{n}(f) v=\int_{\R}f(y)\chi_{n}(y)v\dop y=(\int_{\R}e^{2\pi i n y}f(y)\dop y) v. 
%	\end{align*}
%Then 
%	\begin{align*}
%		\Tr \chi_{n}(f)=\hat{f}(-n). 
%	\end{align*}
%Thus, 	
%	\begin{align*}
%		\Tr R(f)=\sum_{n} \hat{f}(-n). 
%	\end{align*}
%To compute the RHS, note that conjugacy classes are singletons, centralizers are the whole group, so
%	\begin{align*}
%		\Tr R(f)&= \sum_{n\{\Z\}} \vol(\Gamma_{n}\lmod G_{n}) \int_{\{1\}} f(n) \dop x \\
%			&=\sum_{n\in \Z} \vol(\Z\lmod \R) f(n)=\sum_{n}f(n). 
%	\end{align*}
%	Thus, the trace formula is, for any smooth $f$ compactly supported on $\R$
%	\begin{align*}
%		\sum_{n}\hat{f}(-n) = \sum_{n}f(n). 
%	\end{align*}
\section{$\SL(2,\R)$}
Let $G=\SL(2,\R)$ and $\Gamma \leq G$ be a compact lattice. Taking for granted that there are no issues with convergence, the trace formula reads: (Recalling that $\cdot_{\gamma}$ is the centralizer of $\gamma$ in $\cdot$, and that $R^{\Gamma}$ is the right regular action of $G$ on $L^{2}(\Gamma \setminus G)$) for a test function $f\in C_{c}^{\infty}(G)$, 
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_ {\pi \in \hat{G}} m_{\pi}^{\Gamma}\Tr \pi(f)= \Tr R^{\Gamma}(f)= \sum_{\gamma\in \{\gamma\}} \vol (\Gamma_{\gamma} \lmod G_{\gamma}) \int_{G_{\gamma}\lmod G} f(g^{-1}\gamma g) \dop g.
	\end{align*} 
The aim of this talk is to demonstrate how this formula manifests in the following
\begin{thm}
	Let $\{\lambda_{j}\}$ be the eigenvalues of the hyperbolic Laplacian acting on $L^{2}(\Gamma \lmod \half)$, and $g\in C_{c}^{\infty}(\R)$. Then
		\begin{align*}
			\sum \hat{g}(\sqrt{\lambda_{j}-1/4}) = \frac{\vol (\Gamma \lmod \half)}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{\infty}\hat{g}(r) r\tanh(r)\dop r +1/2 \sum_{\gamma \in \{\Gamma\}} \frac{\ell(\gamma_{o})}{e^{\ell(\gamma)/2}-e^{-\ell(\gamma)/2}} g(\ell(\gamma))			
		\end{align*}
	where $\hat{g}$ is the Euclidean Fourier transform of $g$; where $\gamma_{o}$ is the generator of $\Gamma_{\gamma}$ (hence primitive geodesic in the class); and $\ell(\gamma)$ is the translation length of $\gamma$.   
\end{thm}
\subsection{Structure of $\SL(2,\R)$}
	Put coordinates on $G$ via the Iwasawa decomposition $G=NAK$:
	\begin{align*}
		A&=\{ a(u)=\amat{u}: u\in \R\}  \\ 
		N&=\{ n(x)=\nmat{x}: x \in \R\} \\
		K&= \{ k(\theta)=\kmat{\theta}: \theta \in [0,2\pi)\}. 
	\end{align*}
%With respect to these coordinates, the haar measure on $G$ is  
%	 \begin{align*}
%		\dop g = \frac{1}{2\pi} \dop u \dop x \dop \theta, 
%	\end{align*}
	Classification of conjugacy classes: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $g \in G$ is hyperbolic if 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item $\Tr g >2$

\subsection{Spectral side}
To understand the RHS, we need to compute $\Tr \pi (f)$ for those $\pi \in \hat{G}$ with $m_{\pi}^{\gamma}\neq 0$. To do this, we relate these $\pi$ with special functions on $\Gamma \lmod \half$.  Here's the theorem:
\begin{thm}
	Suppose $m_{\pi}^{\Gamma}\neq 0$. Then $\pi^{K}$  (that is, the right $K$ invariant vectors in $\pi$) is one dimensional, say $\pi^{K}=\C\phi$. Then, upon identifying $\phi$ with a function on $\Gamma \lmod \half$, we have
		\begin{align*}
			\Delta^{\half} \phi = \lambda \phi
		\end{align*}
	for $\lambda \in \R_{\geq 0}$ dependent only on the isomorphism class of $\pi$. 
\end{thm} 
	Essence of proof:  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The convolution algebra of left-and-right $K$ invariant functions on $G$ is commutative: use Cartan decomposition $G=KAK$ to show first that functions on $K\lmod G / K$ are invariant under transpose, then note that transpose induces an anti-automorphism of $C_{c}^{\infty}(K\lmod G/ K)$, which is the identity. 
		\item Irreducible unitary reps of $G$ appearing in $L^{2}(\Gamma \lmod G)$ are admissible (meaning the restriction of the rep to $K$  is completely reducible, with irreducible constituents having finite multiplicity). 
		\item For an irreducible admissible rep $\pi$, the subspace $\pi^{K}$ affords a representation of $C_{c}^{\infty}(K\lmod G / K)$ which is irreducible. Irreducible reps of a commutative algebra are at most one dimensional. 
		\item Under the identification of functions on $\Gamma \lmod \half$ with right $K$ invariant, left $\Gamma$ invariant functions on $G$, the hyperbolic Laplacian agrees with the Casimir operator of G up to a constant. 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Quick and dirty on Casimir:\\
				 The action of $G$ on $C^{\infty}(G)$ induces an action of its Lie algebra via the formula 
					\begin{align*}
						R(X)f(g)=\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} R(\exp(tX))f(g)=\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}f(g\exp(e^{tX})). 
					\end{align*}
					Thus, we can view $R$ as a Lie algebra homomorphism $\g$ into the associative algebra of differential operators on $G$ such that $R([X,Y])=R(X)R(Y)-R(Y)R(X)$. The universal object for such maps is $\mathcal{U} (\g)$, the universal enveloping algebra: this is an associative algebra and a map $\g \to \mathcal{U}(\g)$ such that any Lie algebra map of $\g$ into an associative algebra (turning Lie bracket into commutant) factors through a unique associative algebra map from  $\mathcal{U}(\g)$.  \emph{This is all to say that $\mathcal{U}(\g)$ is the smallest place in which it is meaningful to take products of Lie algebra elements}. 
					\item  The center of $\mathcal{U}(\g)$ is manifestly the algebra of differential operators on $G$ which commute with the action of $G$. The Casimir is a distinguished element of the center, constructed as follows:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item We'll contrive a nonzero algebra map $\End \g \to \mathcal{U}(\g)$ and take Casimir to be the image of the identity (which is certainly in the center): \\
						First, use the canonical map $\End \g \to \g \otimes \g^{*}$, then use a nondegenerate bilinear form on $\g$  to pin down an isomorphism $\g \to \g^{*}$ to obtain a map $\End \g \to \g \otimes \g$. Then use the canonical inclusion $\g \otimes \g$ into the tensor algebra $\bigotimes \g $, and quotient by brackets to get a map to $\mathcal{U}(\g)$. 
					\end{itemize}
				\item With the basis of $\g$ 
					\begin{align*}
						h=\Tbt{1}{0}{0}{-1} \quad e= \Tbt{0}{1}{0}{0}   \quad f= \Tbt{0}{0}{1}{0}
					\end{align*}
					and using the trace form to make the identification of $\g$ with its dual, we have  
					\begin{align*}
						h^{*}=h \quad e^{*}= f/2   \quad f^{*}= e/2.
					\end{align*}
					so Casimir is $h^{2}+2ef+2fe$.
					\item We want to compute the action of this differential operator on left $K$ invariant functions on $G$. To do this, first note that $e-f$ exponentiates into $K$, so will act by zero on left $K$ invariant functions. So we'll compute $h^{2}+4e^{2}$.   
					\item  Exponentials are
						\begin{align*}
							\exp(th)&= a(t)=\amat{t} \\
							\exp(te)&=n(t)=\nmat{t}
						\end{align*}
					so compute, for right $K$ invariant $f$ on $G$, using the fact that $A$ normalizes $N$ via $a(-u)n(x)a(a)=n(e^{u}x)$ so $n(x)a(u)=a(u)a(-u)n(x)a(u)=a(u)n(e^{u}x)$
						\begin{align*}
								R(e)f(n(x)a(u))&=\dbdt|_{t=0} f(n(x)a(u)n(t))=\dbdt|_{t=0}f(n(x+e^{ut})a(u))= e^{u}\frac{\partial}{\partial_{x}}f(n(x)a(u))\\
								R(h)f(n(x)a(u))&=\dbdt|_{t=0}f(n(x)a(u)a(t))=\dbdt|_{t=0}f(n(x)a(u+t))=\frac{\partial}{\partial u} f(n(x)a(u))
						\end{align*}
				%%%resolve this nonsense.
				\end{itemize}
			\item Because casimir commutes with $G$, it provides an $G$-invariant automorphism of any irreducible to itself. Thus, by schur, it acts as a scalar on that irreducible. I.e. the one dimensional subspace $\pi^{K}$ of $\pi$ appearing in $L^{2}(\Gamma\lmod G)$ is in fact an eigenspace of casimir.
			\item Since laplacian and casimir agree up to scale on left $K$ invariant functions on $G$,  this shows that the function in $\pi^{K}$ is in fact a laplacian eigenfunction. 
	\end{itemize}
		So now we look at the irreps $\pi$ of $G$ such that $\pi^{K}$ is one dimensional. These are called \emph{spherical} representations.
		\subsection{Spherical representations of $\SL(2,\R)$}.
			 Consider the subgroup 
				 \begin{align*}
					B=AN=\Tbt{*}{*}{0}{*}.
				\end{align*} 
		Parametrize the multiplicative characters on $B$ by
			\begin{align*}
				\chi_{s}(\Tbt{a}{b}{0}{a^{-1}})=|a|^{s},
			\end{align*}
			and induce from $\chi_{s}$ the representation
				\begin{align*}
					V_{s}=\{ \phi:G\to \C: \phi(bg)=\chi_{s+1}(b)\phi(g)\}.
				\end{align*}
		(the $+1$ is a normalization that we'll benefit from later). Since $G=NAK$, a function in $V_{s}$ is determined by its values on $K$. Denote by $\pi_{s}$ the $\phi \in V_{s}$ such that $\phi|_{K} \in L^{2}(K)$. Let $G$ act on $\pi_{s}$ by right translation. Then
	\begin{thm}
	When $s$ is not an odd integer, $\pi_{s}$ is irreducible with $\dim \pi_{s}^{K}=1$.  When  $s$ is an odd integer, $\pi_{s}$ has a unique irreducible subquotient which we'll renotate to $\pi_{s}$. Every irreducible spherical representation of $G$ arises as a $\pi_{s}$ and pairs $\pi_{s},\pi_{s'}$ are distinct unless $s=\pm s'$. 
	\end{thm}
	In order for  $\m_{\pi_{s}}^{K}\neq0$ we need $\pi_{s}$ to be unitary. The pairing on $\pi_{s_{1}}\times \pi_{s_{2}}$ 
		\begin{align*}
			\ip{\phi_{1}}{\phi_{2}}=\int_{K}\phi_{1}(k)\overline{\phi_{2}(k)}\dop k
		\end{align*}
	is $G$ invariant precisely when $s_{1}=-\overline s_{2}$ and thus gives a $G$ invariant innerproduct on $\pi_{s}$ when $s\in i\R$.  \\
	
	When $s \in(0,1)$, the map $M(s): \phi \mapsto  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\Tbt{0}{-1}{1}{0} \Tbt{1}{x}{0}{1} \cdot) \dop x$ is an intertwining map $\pi_{s}\to \pi_{-s}$, which induces an inner product on $\pi_{s}$ iff $s\in(-1,1)$. 
	\begin{thm}
		These irreducible unitary spherical reps of $G$ are the $\pi_{s}$ with $s\in i\R \cup (-1,1)$. 
	\end{thm}
Since each of these $\pi_{s}$ are irreducible, casimir acts on it by a scalar. To compute this scalar, it suffices to compute its value on a $\phi \in \pi_{s}^{K}$ which we normalize to take the value $1$ on $K$. Then identifying $\phi$ with a function on $\half$, the condition 
	\begin{align*}
		 \phi(bg)=\chi_{s+1}(b)\phi(g)
	\end{align*}
translates to
	\begin{align*}
		\phi(x+iy)=y^{(s+1)/2}
	\end{align*}
and since casimir is laplacian, the casimir eigenvalue is obtained by
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta^{\half}\phi(x+iy)=y^{2}(\frac{\partial^{2}l}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}l}{\partial y^{2}})y^{(s+1)/2} =\frac{(s+1)(s-1)}{4}y^{(s+1)/2}. 
	\end{align*}
	 Casmir acts on $\pi_{s}$  by $(s^{2}-1)/4$.  \\
From all of this, we conclude:
	\begin{align*}
		m_{\pi_{s}}^{\Gamma}=\dim \{ \phi : \half \to \C \vert \Delta^{\half}\phi = \frac{s^{2}-1}{4} \phi\}
	\end{align*}
To finish our analysis of the LHS, we'll compute the traces $\Tr \pi_{s}(f)$ for $f\in C^{\infty}_{c}(K\lmod G / K)$. Recalling that this algebra is commutative, it acts by a scalar on irreducibles, and its trace is that scalar. To compute that scalar, check it on the unique function $\phi \in \pi_{s}^{K}$ such that $\phi(1)=1$: compute
	\begin{align*}
		(\pi_{s}(f)\phi)(1)&=\int_{G}f(g) R(g)\phi(1))\dop g\\ 
					&=\int_{G}f(g)\phi(g)\dop g\\ 
					&=\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\R}\int_{\R}\int_{[0.2\pi)} f(n(x)a(u)k(\theta)) \phi(n(x)a(u)k(\theta))\dop \theta \dop u \dop x  \\
					&=\int_{\R}\int_{\R}f(n(x)a(u)) \phi(n(x)a(u)k(\theta))\dop u \dop x \\
					&=\int_{\R}\int_{\R}f(\nmat{x}\amat{u}) \chi_{s+1}(\amat{u}) \dop u \dop x\\
					&=\int_{\R}\int_{\R}f(\Tbt{e^{u/2}}{e^{u/2}x}{0}{e^{-u/2}}) e^{\frac{u(1+s)}{2}} \dop u \dop x\\
					&=\int_{\R}\int_{\R}f(\Tbt{e^{u/2}}{x}{0}{e^{-u/2}})e^{us/2}\dop u \dop x\\
	\end{align*}

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
\begin{comment}
The primary focus of my research is the spectral geometry of Riemannian mani folds, with an emphasis on the locally symmetric spaces associated to arithmetic lattices in Lie groups. My work makes essential use of geometric topology, harmonic analysis, algebraic groups, number theory, arithmetic/algebraic/differential geometry, and automorphic  forms. This topic interacts with class field theory, Galois cohomology and $K–$forms of linear algebraic g roups, Bruhat–Tits theory, and the geometry/topology of symmetric and locally symmetric spaces. It has direct connections to Riemannian geometry, geometric analysis, algebraic/arithmetic geometry, and the Langlands’ program.
\end{comment}
A principal technique in geometry  is to reduce  problems of the form:  
 
\begin{problem}\label{prob:geo}
Given two objects $X_1$ and  $X_2$ living in some class $C$, how does one determine if $X_1$ and $X_2$ are identical?
\end{problem}
to  one of the form:
\begin{problem}\label{prob:grp} 
	Given subgroups $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ of a group $G$, how does one determine if $\Gamma_1$ is conjugate to $\Gamma_2$ in $G$?
\end{problem}
In many cases, this latter problem is more tractable. For example, as will be the case in this proposal, when the ambient group $G$ is a semisimple Lie group, one may approach the problem through its harmonic analysis and dynamics. When $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are known to be lattices in $G$, then one gains powerful tools through trace formulae of various forms.
In the context of this paper, the class $C$ is the moduli space $\Mcal_g$ of
compact, smooth, hyperbolic surfaces of a fixed genus $g$,  and we investigate
the former question under certain hypotheses on the eigenvalue spectrum of the
Laplace-Beltrami operator\ acting on  square integrable sections of certain flat
vector bundles over such surfaces. The space of such bundles can be identified
with a certain character variety $\Ucal_{g}$. Using an analogy between
geometry and number theory, popularized by Sunada, we use the Artin-Takagi
formalism, to encode this problem in certain entire fuctions called
Selberg zeta functions. A principal aim of the proposed project is to study this spectrum as a function
of both the \textit{metric} and the \textit{bundle}. 
Investigation of spectra as a function of the metric was popularized by the
famous question posed by Kac:  \emph{Can you hear the shape of a drum?}   The answer to depends on the drum. On the one hand, there exist
Riemannian manifolds of all manners of shapes which sound identical; these
manifolds are referred to as \textbf{isospectral}. Constructing  new examples of
such spaces is the subject of my first publication, and will be discussed
further in the background section.
On the other hand, there are some very special drums which are determined by
their sounds. We call a closed Riemannian manifold (absolutely)
\textbf{spectrally rigid} if isospectrality implies isometry. It is known that
spectral rigidity is often a generic property
, though there are very few
explicit examples. The content of my graduate this is the identification of some
specific arithmetic hyperbolic $2$ and $3$ manifolds which are spectrally rigid. 
As a function of the bundle, much less is known. In the case that the bundles
are $1$ dimensional and the underlying space is a compact Riemann surface, the
spectrum can be viewed as a function on the universal Hodge bundle \cite{fay1973}, and has been studied in \cite{takhtajan1991} as a function of moduli.	
Using an analogy between geometry and number theory, popularized by Sunada, we
use the Artin-Takagi formalism \cite{venkov1981} to encode this problem with Selberg zeta
functions. These functions can be thought of as an infinite dimensional
analogues of the characteristic polynomial of the twisted Laplacian. 
\section{Background}
\paragraph{Past work: flexibility} The failure of spectral rigidity was first observed in Milnor in 1964 \cite{milnor1964}, where he constructed a pair of isospectral, nonisometric $16$ dimensional flat tori. In a sweeping generalization of Milnor's construction,  Vignéras in \cite{}  described a procedure for producing infinite families of compact hyperbolic $2$ and $3$  manifolds which fail to be spectrally rigid. Her methodology  exploits  a  particular mode of failure of the local-to-global principle for rational conjugacy classes of maximal orders in a quaternion algebra over a number field with sufficiently complicated arithmetic.  A critical step in her argument is an application of the Selberg trace formula to relate the eigenvalue spectrum on the associated locally symmetric spaces with their respective geodesic length spectrum; which in turn is closely related to the solution of an explicit family of diophantine equations.  As her examples are arithmetic, it follows from work of Borel \cite{borel1989} that only finitely such pairs from her construction can have genus at most $g$.
In $1985$, Sunada \cite{sunada1985}  constructed many more examples of isospectral, non-isometric manifolds; his construction produces positive dimensional subspaces of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ that fail to be spectrally rigid provided $g$ is sufficiently large (e.g. if $g > 168$). His construction was motivated by an old construction by Gassman \cite{gassmann1926}. The
construction is elementary, using finite covers and the existence of groups with pairs of subgroups satisfying a condition called {\bf almost conjugate}. 
In my first paper \cite{arapura2019} , in collaboration with Donu Arapura, Partha Solapurkar, and Ben McReynolds, we applied a refined notion of almost conjugacy to  constructed locally symmetric manifolds and complex projective surfaces that share many algebraic and analytic invariants. For example, we produce non-isometric closed hyperbolic n-manifolds, as covers of a fixed manifold, that have isomorphic integral cohomology in such a way that the isomorphism commute with the natural maps induced by the cover. We also produced arbitrarily large collections of pairwise non-isomorphic smooth projective surfaces where the isomorphisms are natural with respect to the Hodge structure, or as Galois modules. In particular, the projective surface have isomorphic Picard and Albanese varieties, and have isomorphic effective Chow motives. All of these examples also have the same eigenvalue and geodesic length spectrum for their associated Riemannian structures. The construction based on a refinement of Sunada's method, based on examples first discovered by L. Scott \cite{scott1993integral}   and recently used by D. Prasad \cite{prasad2017}, in a construction that partly motivated ours.
\paragraph{Spectral rigidity} \label{par:specrigidity}
Despite the failure of spectral rigidity, there have been several positive
results. In 1982, Wolpert  \cite{wolpert1978}  proved that a generic (in the
Baire sense) Riemann surface is determined by its spectrum. In 1992,
Reid proved that if $X$ is an arithmetic Riemann surface, then any Riemann
surface $Y$ that is isospectral to $X$ must be commensurable with $X$ \cite{reid1992a}. In
particular, $Y$ must be arithmetic. The content of my thesis is the
determination of a particular collection of arithmetic  hyperbolic surfaces
which are, in fact, spectrally rigid. Before I can state my theorem, we need
some terminology.
First,  we define arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces. Let  $\kbf$ be a totally real number field with ring of integers $\obf$,  and $\Bbf$ an indefinite quaternion algebra over $\kbf$ which is split at a unique real place of $\kbf$. That is to say, among all of the inclusions $\rho:  \kbf \to \Rbb$, there is a unique  one $\rho_o$ such that $\Bbf \otimes_{\kbf}  \kbf_{\rho_o} $ is isomorphic to the algebra of two by two matrices over $\kbf_{\rho_o} =\Rbb$, the completion of $\kbf$ at $\rho_o$.  We will also use the symbol $\rho_o$ to denote the resulting inclusion $\Bbf \to \Bbf \otimes_{\kbf}  \kbf_{\rho_o} $. An {\bf order} $\Obf$ in $\Bbf$ is an $\obf$ subalgebra of $\Bbf$ of maximal rank.  Let $\Obf^1$ denote the multiplicative subgroup  of $\Obf$ consisting of elements of reduced norm  $1$.  Then $\rho_o$ yields an identification $\Obf^1$ with a lattice $\Gamma_\Obf$ in $\SL(2,\Rbb)$.  We say that a lattice $\Lambda$ in $\SL(2,\Rbb)$ is {\bf arithmetic}  if there exists some $\Obf$ in some $\Bbf$ over some $\kbf$ such that some $\GL(2,\Rbb)$ conjugate of $\Lambda$ is commensurable with $\Gamma_{\Obf}$.  For any lattice $\Lambda$ in $\SL(2,\Rbb)$, we let $X(\Lambda)$ denote the associated hyperbolic orbifold  $\Lambda \lmod \SL(2,\Rbb) \rmod  \SO(2)$.  We say that a quaternion algebra $\Bbf$ over $\kbf$ has {\bf type number one} if it has a unique $\Bbf^\times$ conjugacy class of maximal orders.  Let $\mathbf{I}$ be an ideal in $\obf$ not divisible by any prime over which $\Bbf$ is ramified.   Write $\Gamma_\Obf(\mathbf{I}) \leq \Gamma_\Obf$ for the  {\bf principal congruence kernel mod $\mathbf{I}$} . Note that normal inclusion of $\Gamma_\Obf(\mathbf{I})$ in $\Gamma_\Obf$ induces a regular cover $X(\Gamma_\Obf(\mathbf{I}))$ over $X(\Gamma_\Obf)$, with deck group isomorphic to  $\Gamma_\Obf(\mathbf{I})  \lmod \Gamma_\Obf = \SL(2,\obf /\mathbf{I}).$  We are now prepared to state the theorem:
 \begin{thm}
 	Let $\kbf, \obf, \Bbf, \mathbf{I}$ be as above. Suppose further that $\Bbf$ has {\bf type number $1$}. Let $\Obf$ be a representative of the single conjugacy class of maximal orders in $\Bbf$. The surface $X(\Gamma_\Obf(\pbf))$  is spectrally rigid. 
 \end{thm}
This theorem is the first, to my knowledge, which  produces infinitely many infinite families of Riemannian manifolds which are demonstrably spectrally rigid. By carefully  choosing $\kbf,$ and $\Bbf,$ one can  apply this theorem to the principal congruence Hurwitz surfaces, partially confirming a conjecture of Alan Reid \cite{reid2014}. 
\section{Proposal}
To study the relationship among Dedekind zeta functions of number fields, number theorists study their factorizations into Artin $L$-functions associated to Galois representations representations. Following their lead, we introduce the analogous $L$ functions and study factorizations of Selberg's zeta function. Fix a compact negatively curved Riemannian manifold $M$, with fundamental group $\Gamma$. Let $\rho: \Gamma \to U(V)$ be a unitary representation on a finite dimensional Hilbert space $V$. Let
\[	L_{M,\rho}(s) = \prod_{\gamma} \prod_{k=0}^\infty   \det ( \id_V -  \rho(\gamma)\exp^{-(s+k) \ell_M(\gamma) }  ) .\label{slf}\]
These functions satisfy the so-called Artin-Takgai formalism: for a cover $M' \to M$ :
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item  For $\rho$ a unitary representation of $\Gamma' = \pi_1( M' ) \leq \Gamma$, 
	\[ L_{M',\rho} (s)  = L_{M, \ind_{\Gamma'}^{\Gamma_o} \rho} (s),
	 \]  
	 and for a unitary representation $\sigma$ of $\Gamma$,
	\[ L_{M,\sigma} (s)  = L_{M',\res_{\Gamma'}^{\Gamma}\sigma} (s). \]
	\item For a pair $\sigma, \sigma'$ of unitary representations of $\Gamma$, 
	\[ L_{M,\sigma \oplus \sigma' }(s) = L_{M,\sigma}(s) L_{M,\sigma'}(s) \]
\end{enumerate}
Applying the second property above, we may extend the function $L_{M,\cdot} (s)$ from the set ${\rm URep}(M)$ of unitary reps of $\pi_1(M)$ to the additive group ${\rm VURep}(\pi_1(M))$ of virtual unitary representations. Let $T(M)$ be some reasonable space of negatively curved metrics on $M$. Then we may view the assignment $(\mu,\rho) \mapsto L_{\mu,\rho}$ as a meromorphic-function valued function on the space $T(M) \times {\rm VURep(M)}$ which is a homomorphism in the second variable. 
\begin{question}\label{q:multind}
	For which metrics $\mu$ is the homomorphism $L_{\mu, \cdot}$ injective? When it isn't injective, how large is its kernel? 
\end{question} 
This question has a meaningful analogue in number theory, whereat the answer is positive \cite{funakura1978}. It has as an immediate consequence that all arithmetically equivalent number fields arise from Gassman equivalence\cite{perlis1977}. A positive answer to \cref{q:multind} will show that all instances of isospectrality within a commensurability class must arise from Sunada's construction. 
 
\begin{question}
 Fix a twist $\rho$. For which spaces of metrics $T(M)$ on $M$ is the function $L_{\cdot, \rho}$ injective on $T(M)$?
\end{question}
When $M$ is a compact surface of genus $g>1$, a natural candidate is the space $\Mcal_g$ of hyperbolic metrics.
Inside of ${\rm VURep(M)}$ is the subgroup ${\rm FVUrep(M)}$ consisting of those virtual representations which admit a continuous extension to the profinite completion of $\pi_1(M)$). 
\begin{question}\label{q:multind2}
	Supposing the answer to \cref{q:multind} is negative, must the kernel intersect ${\rm FVURep(M)}$ nontrivially? 
\end{question}
Now suppose that $M$ is an arithmetic hyperbolic $2$ or $3$ manifold of the form $ \mathbf{G}(k) \lmod \mathbf{G}(\Abb_k) / \prod_{\pfrak<\infty} \mathbf{G}(\Ocal_\pfrak) $  for some inner form $\mathbf{G}$ of $\SL_2$ and write $\Gamma $ for the corresponding  Fuchsian or Kleinian lattice in $G:= \mathbf{G}(k^\infty)$. The unitary representations of $\Gamma$ which factor through a finite \emph{congruence quotient} are precisely those which extend continuously to $K:= \prod_{\pfrak<\infty} \mathbf{G}(\Ocal_\pfrak)$. Write $\mathrm{CFVURep}(M)$ the subgroup of $\mathrm{FVURep}(M)$ generated by these representations.  
\begin{question}\label{q:multind3}
	Supposing the answer to \cref{q:multind2} is negative, must the kernel intersect ${\rm CFVURep(M)}$ nontrivially? 
\end{question}
As mentioned in \cref{par:specrigidity}, Alan Reid proved that isospectral arithmetic hyperbolic $2$ and $3$ manifolds must be commensurable.  
\begin{question}
  Let $M$ and $M'$ be isospectral nonarithmetic hyperbolic $2$ or $3$ manifolds
  $M$ and $M'$ be commensurable?  
  \end{question}
If this is so, then if paired with a positive answer to \cref{q:multind}, one would have a complete characterization of isospectrality for such manifolds. 
 
\section{Career development}
In pursuing the research objectives of this project, further investigating related literature, interacting with
other researchers and collaborators, and producing articles related to this work, I will develop my skills as
a mathematical researcher. Working within the 
Geometry and Topology group at Temple university,  will give me the opportunity to extend my knowledge of these fields dramatically. In particular, communicating with this large and active group of faculty and graduate students will provide me with an excellent opportunity to broaden my mathematical and collaborative abilities. 
 	
\section{Sponsoring scientist}
Matthew Stover is a world expert in the geometry of locally symmetric spaces. Many of his published results make prove incisive theorems regarding the geometry of closed geodesics on such spaces. I believe that many of these results can be passed through relevant trace formulae to produce interesting theorems about their spectral geometry. I have met with Stover at several conferences over the last three years; most recently at the Geometry, Topology, and Groups conference in honor of his advisor Alan Reid's 60th birthday. His record of mentorship is exemplary. While at the 2019 summer school at MSRI, I had the pleasure of interacting with two of Stover's Ph.D. students, with both of whom I have had since fruitful mathematical correspondences.   
\section{Broader impact}
I believe that mathematics is a fundamentally collaborative enterprise; that \emph{communicating} is an essential aspect of \emph{research}; and that teaching is a critical component of learning. I will strive to ensure a positive and inclusive community both within Temple university and throughout the Philadelphia area. I believe that access to mathematics is a fundamental human right, and I will work to eliminate barriers from its pursuit.

\begin{document} 
	\maketitle
\paragraph{Overview} The overall goal of the proposed project is to investigate the Laplace eigenvalue spectrum of certain closed Riemannian manifolds, and their interaction with twists by unitary representations. The primary focus of this program is to analyze said spectrum for compact hyperbolic surfaces and to give a complete classification of isospectrality for them. In his graduate thesis, the PI has established an absolute spectral rigidity theorem for a certain class of hyperbolic arithmetic $2$ and $3$ manifolds. The techniques used to prove this result have promising further applications.
The PI will examine the  extent to which certain properties of hyperbolic surfaces are determined by their spectrum, or twists thereof. A primary goal is to determine whether the commensurability class of a non-arithmetic hyperbolic surface is such a property. Another property that will be investigated is whether the spectrum detects the location of a surface within certain strata in the moduli space of such surfaces. 
The PI will investigate the analogy between the geodesic geometry  negatively curved Riemannian manifolds and arithmetic of ideals in number fields. In particular, he will pursue analogues of standard number theoretic results about Dedekind zeta functions and their factorizations into Artin L-functions, in terms of Selberg's zeta functions. 
\paragraph{Intellectual Merit}
The novelty of the techniques employed by the PI will serve to advance the state of knowledge in geometry and topology. His application of the aforementioned analogy will serve to further the development of both number theory and geometry. More specifically, the concrete interpretation of zeroes of Selberg's zeta functions as eigenvalues of twisted Laplace operators will lead to interesting heuristics for the much less understood zeroes of Dedekind's zeta and Artin's $L$ functions. 
\paragraph{Broader Impact}
Through the course of the proposed project, the PI will be an active member in the mathematical community at Temple University. He will actively pursue opportunities to mentor undergraduate and graduate students in the department. Furthermore, the PI will strive to expose a broader audience, both within the university and in the surrounding Philadelphia area. The PI has a robust history of teaching mathematics and mentoring undergraduates and junior graduate students. The PI is committed to fostering a safe environment for learning. He will actively seek to ensure that the environment is welcoming to groups which are marginalized or are otherwise underrepresented in mathematics.

I am writing to apply for the Caltech-Tsinghua joint postdoctoral fellowship (Fellowship ID #21163).
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, under the direction of D.B. McReynolds. I expect to complete my degree by May of 2023. My research interests include geometry and topology, spectral theory, number theory, representation theory, harmonic analysis, and interactions thereof. My thesis work concerns an absolute spectral rigidity result, which applies to a large class of arithmetic hyperbolic 2 and 3 manifolds.  One application of this theorem proves that all principal congruence Hurwitz surfaces are spectrally rigid. I have also co-authored a paper in which we construct large collections of algebraic and differential geometric objects which are indistinguishable by means of various invariants.
 I consider teaching to be an essential role of the mathematician, and am committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and open environment for students. 
Please find my curriculum vitae and research and teaching statements attached. Letters in support of my application, written by D.B. McReynolds, J. LaFont, and A. Reid, will be submitted through the forms on mathjobs.com.  Please contact me for any further information.

The geometry and topology department at UIUC is an ideal environment for my development as a mathematician, and I would cherish an opportunity to contribute to this environment. I had the pleasure of eating lunch with Prof. N. Dunfield at the conference in honor of Prof. A. Reid during the summer of 2022 in Austin, Texas. I enjoyed our conversation, especially regarding certain computation aspects of theory of arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

I am writing to apply for the postion fo Benjamin Peirce Fellow in Mathematics  at Harvard University (Position ID # 20397).
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, under the direction of D.B. McReynolds. I expect to complete my degree by May of 2023. My research interests include geometry and topology, spectral theory, number theory, representation theory, harmonic analysis, and interactions thereof. My thesis work concerns an absolute spectral rigidity result, which applies to a large class of arithmetic hyperbolic 2 and 3 manifolds.  One application of this theorem proves that all principal congruence Hurwitz surfaces are spectrally rigid. I have also co-authored a paper in which we construct large collections of algebraic and differential geometric objects which are indistinguishable by means of various invariants.
 I consider teaching to be an essential role of the mathematician, and am committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and open environment for students. 
Please find my curriculum vitae and research and teaching statements attached. Letters in support of my application, written by D.B. McReynolds, M. Stover, J. LaFont, A. Reid, and J. Chen, will be submitted through the forms on mathjobs.com.  Please contact me for any further information.

	The basic rule here is to keep it straightforward –
	it will probably be read by someone who is not an expert in your particular field,
	and who has hundreds of applications to get through. 
	
	It’s thus more important
	to indicate clearly how your research accomplishments and goals fit into the broad
	scheme of things, than to give all the technical details. 
	
	Try to format the research
	statement so that it can be easily skimmed: for example, you might put the most

	\maketitle
	\paragraph{Introduction}\label{intro} The primary focus of my research is the spectral geometry of Riemannian manifolds, with an emphasis on the locally symmetric spaces associated to arithmetic lattices in Lie groups. My work makes essential use of geometric topology, harmonic analysis, algebraic groups, number theory, arithmetic/algebraic/differential geometry, and automorphic  forms. This topic interacts with class field theory, Galois cohomology and $K–$forms of linear algebraic groups, Bruhat–Tits theory, and the geometry/topology of symmetric and locally symmetric spaces. It has direct connections to Riemannian geometry, geometric analysis, algebraic/arithmetic geometry, and the Langlands’ program.
	
	\paragraph{Background}\label{bg}The interplay of number theory and Riemanian geometry has a long history of producing incisive results in both fields. Underlying many of these interactions is a rich analogy between on the one hand: \emph{a compact negatively curved Riemannian manifold $M$ along with its system of finite covering spaces}; and on the other:  \emph{a ring  $\obf$ of integers inside an algebraic number field $\kbf$, along with their finite extensions}. Under this analogy \emph{the prime ideals $\pbf$ of $\obf$ } find their geometric counterparts among \emph{the primitive closed geodesics $\gamma$ in $M$} .  Just as one can \emph{measure  the size of a prime $\pbf$ in $\obf$} via the absolute norm map $N_\kbf(\pbf) =\# \left(\obf /\pbf\right) $ , so too can one \emph{measure the  size of a closed geodesic $\gamma$  on $M$}, via its length $\ell_M(\gamma)$.
	
	Associated to such an  $\obf \leq \kbf$, one introduces the {\bf Dedekind zeta function,}  defined in a suitable right half-plane as a product over prime ideals $\pbf$ in $\obf$ 
	\[ \zeta_\kbf (s)  = \prod_{\pbf} 	( 1 - N_\kbf (\pbf)^{-s})^\inv, \]   
	which encodes structural information about the asymptotics of the \emph{prime counting function} $ \pi_\kbf (x) = \# \{ \pbf : N_\kbf(\pbf) < x\}$  in terms of the nature of the singularity of $\zeta_\kbf (s)$ at $s=1$. This amounts to the Landau's extension of Euler's prime number theorem:  $\pi_\kbf(x)$ is asympotically $x/\log x$.   In his epoch-making paper \cite{selberg1956harmonic}, Selberg introduced a zeta function associated to a compact negatively curved riemannian manifold $M$, defined entirely by analogy, for $s$ in a suitable right half plane, as a product over the set of primitive closed geodesics $\gamma$ on $M$:
	\[	\zeta_M(s) = \prod_{\gamma} \prod_{k=0}^\infty   ( 1 -  \exp^{-(s+k) \ell_M(\gamma) }  ) .\label{szf}\]
	Exactly as before, one finds that the asymptotics of the \emph{primitive geodesic counting function} $\pi_M(x) = \# \{ \gamma : \ell_M (\gamma)  < x\}$ are encoded in the behavior of $\zeta_M(s)$ as $s$  approaches the abcissa of absolute convergence of $\zeta_M$.  As an inaugural application of his trace formula, he showed that for $M$ a compact Riemann surface, one has a \emph{prime geodesic theorem}: just as for primes in number fields, one has asymptotically $\pi_M(x) = x / \log x$. In the intervening years, Huber \cite{huber1959}, Sarnak \cite{sarnak1981}, and Margulis \cite{margulis1969} proved, for increasingly general $M$, that these prime geodesic theorems persist. 
	
	The analytic properties of number theoretic zeta and $L$ functions are deeply mysterious. Many foundational questions  (some of which are several centuries  old, and carry a hefty monetary bounty on their solution) remain unanswered.  By contrast, the analytic properties of Selberg's zeta functions are inherent to their design. In particular, there is a structural description of the zeroes of $\zeta_M(s)$  in terms of the harmonic analysis on $M$. If $\Delta_M$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$, then for $s \in \Cbb$ away from the spectrum of $\Delta_M$, the resolvent $ (\Delta _M- s )^\inv$  is a compact, self adjoint operator for $s$ away from the spectrum of $\Delta_M$.  Selberg's insight in  \cite{selberg1956harmonic} is that, up to some topological fudge-factors,  his zeta function $\zeta_M(s)$ is precisely the Fredholm determinant $\det(\Delta_M - s)^\inv )$.  Many analytic features of $\zeta_M(s)$ are now evident: at least formally, 
	\[ \zeta_M(s) = \det(\Delta_M - s)^\inv \label{fredet} \] 
	is the reciprocal of the characteristic polynomial  of $\Delta_M$. One expects, and indeed it is so, that the poles of $\zeta_M(s)$ must then occur at the eigenvalues of  $\Delta_M$, with the order at a pole $\lambda$  coniciding with the dimension of the eigenspace $E_\lambda$.  A convenient outcome of this simultaneous description of $\zeta_M(s)$  in terms of its Euler product \ref{szf} and as a Fredholm determinant \ref{fredet}  is that two (compact negatively curved) Riemannian manifolds $M_1,M_2$, are Laplace-isospectral (i.e.  the functions $s \mapsto \dim \ker(\Delta_{M_1}  - s)$ and $s \mapsto \dim \ker(\Delta_{M_2}  - s)$ coincide identically on $\Cbb$)   if and only if their Selberg zeta functions coincide (i.e.  the characteristic polynomials of $\Delta_{M_1}$ and $\Delta_{M_2}$ coincide). 
\1
	In terms of Selberg's zeta function, the problem of spectral rigidity is easily posed: 
	\begin{mdframed}
		Suppose $M_1$ and $M_2$ are two Riemannian manifolds such that their Selberg zeta functions coincide identically, i.e.  $\zeta_{M_1}= \zeta_{M_2}$ as meromorphic functions.  Must $M_1$ and $M_2$ be isometric? 	
	\end{mdframed}
	Thinking of the assignment $\zeta_\cdot : M \mapsto \zeta_M$ as a meromorphic-function-valued function on the space of isometry classes of closed Riemannian manifolds, we say that $M$ is {\bf spectrally rigid} if $\zeta_\cdot $ is injective at $M$.  Riemannian manifolds $M$ which are not spectrally rigid are {\bf spectrally flexible}. For flexible $M$, one wishes to understand the fiber of the $\zeta_\cdot $ at $M$. For example, what additional invariants must you compute in order to distinguish $M$ from its spectral companions?
	
	\paragraph{Past work: flexibility} The failure of spectral rigidity was first observed in Milnor in 1964 \cite{milnor1964}, where he constructed a pair of isospectral, nonisometric $16$ dimensional flat tori. In a sweeping generalization of Milnor's construction,  Vignéras in \cite{vigneras1980}  described a procedure for producing infinite families of compact hyperbolic $2$ and $3$  manifolds which fail to be spectrally rigid. Her methodology  exploits  a  particular mode of failure of the local-to-global principle for rational conjugacy classes of maximal orders in a quaternion algebra over a number field with sufficiently complicated arithmetic.  A critical step in her argument is an application of the Selberg trace formula to relate the eigenvalue spectrum on the associated locally symmetric spaces with their respective geodesic length spectrum; which in turn is closely related to the solution of an explicit family of diophantine equations.  As her examples are arithmetic, it follows from work of Borel \cite{borel1989} that only finitely such pairs from her construction can have genus at most $g$.
	
	In $1985$, Sunada \cite{sunada1985}  constructed many more examples of isospectral, non-isometric manifolds; his construction produces positive dimensional subspaces of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ that fail to be spectrally rigid provided $g$ is sufficiently large (e.g. if $g > 168$). His construction was motivated by an old construction by Gassman \cite{gassmann1926}. The
	construction is elementary, using finite covers and the existence of groups with pairs of subgroups satisfying a condition called {\bf almost conjugate}. 
	
	In my first paper \cite{arapura2019} , in collaboration with Donu Arapura, Partha Solapurkar, and Ben McReynolds, we applied a refined notion of almost conjugacy to  constructed locally symmetric manifolds and complex projective surfaces that share many algebraic and analytic invariants. For example, we produce non-isometric closed hyperbolic n-manifolds, as covers of a fixed manifold, that have isomorphic integral cohomology in such a way that the isomorphism commute with the natural maps induced by the cover. We also produced arbitrarily large collections of pairwise non-isomorphic smooth projective surfaces where the isomorphisms are natural with respect to the Hodge structure, or as Galois modules. In particular, the projective surface have isomorphic Picard and Albanese varieties, and have isomorphic effective Chow motives. All of these examples also have the same eigenvalue and geodesic length spectrum for their associated Riemannian structures. The construction based on a refinement of Sunada's method, based on examples first discovered by L. Scott \cite{scott1993integral}   and recently used by D. Prasad \cite{prasad2017}, in a construction that partly motivated ours.
\1
	\paragraph{Current work: spectral rigidity}
	Despite the failure of spectral rigidity, there have been several positive results. In 1982, Wolpert  \cite{wolpert1978}  proved that a generic (in the Baire sense) Riemann surface is determined by its spectrum. Generalizing work of Kneser for flat tori, Wolpert proved that for a fixed Riemann surface, there are only finitely many Riemann surfaces with the same eigenvalue spectrum. In 1992, Reid proved that if $X$ is an arithmetic Riemann surface, then any Riemann surface $Y$ that is isospectral to $X$ must be commensurable with $X$. In particular, $Y$ must be arithmetic. The content of my thesis is the determination of a particular collection of arithmetic  hyperbolic surfaces which are, in fact, spectrally rigid. Before I can state my theorem, we need some terminology. 
	
	First,  we define arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces. Let  $\kbf$ be a totally real number field with ring of integers $\obf$,  and $\Bbf$ an indefinite quaternion algebra over $\kbf$ which is split at a unique real place of $\kbf$. That is to say, among all of the inclusions $\rho:  \kbf \to \Rbb$, there is a unique  one $\rho_o$ such that $\Bbf \otimes_{\kbf}  \kbf_{\rho_o} $ is isomorphic to the algebra of two by two matrices over $\kbf_{\rho_o} =\Rbb$, the completion of $\kbf$ at $\rho_o$.  We will also use the symbol $\rho_o$ to denote the resulting inclusion $\Bbf \to \Bbf \otimes_{\kbf}  \kbf_{\rho_o} $. An {\bf order} $\Obf$ in $\Bbf$ is an $\obf$ subalgebra of $\Bbf$ of maximal rank.  Let $\Obf^1$ denote the multiplicative subgroup  of $\Obf$ consisting of elements of reduced norm  $1$.  Then $\rho_o$ yields an identification $\Obf^1$ with a lattice $\Gamma_\Obf$ in $\SL(2,\Rbb)$.  We say that a lattice $\Lambda$ in $\SL(2,\Rbb)$ is {\bf arithmetic}  if there exists some $\Obf$ in some $\Bbf$ over some $\kbf$ such that some $\GL(2,\Rbb)$ conjugate of $\Lambda$ is commensurable with $\Gamma_{\Obf}$.  For any lattice $\Lambda$ in $\SL(2,\Rbb)$, we let $X(\Lambda)$ denote the associated hyperbolic orbifold  $\Lambda \lmod \SL(2,\Rbb) \rmod  \SO(2)$. By the uniformization theorem, every hyperbolic surface $M$ can be realized as a $X(\Lambda)$ for some $\Lambda \leq \SL(2,\Rbb)$, unique up to $\GL(2,\Rbb)$  conjugation. Consequently arithmeticity is a well defined property of the underlying hyperbolic orbifold.  We say that a quaternion algebra $\Bbf$ over $\kbf$ has {\bf type number one} if it has a unique $\Bbf^\times$ conjugacy class of maximal orders.  Let $\Ibf$ be an ideal in $\obf$, and for any subgroup  $\Lambda$ of $\Gamma_\Obf$, let $\Lambda(\Ibf)$ be the kernel of the reduction-mod -$\Ibf$ map $\Gamma_\Obf \to \SL(2,\obf/\Ibf),$  restricted to $\Lambda$.  In particular $\Gamma_\Obf(\Ibf) \leq \Gamma_\Obf$ is the {\bf principal congruence kernel mod } $\Ibf$ . Note that normal inclusion of $\Gamma_\Obf(\Ibf)$ in $\Gamma_\Obf$ induces a regular cover $X(\Gamma_\Obf(\Ibf))$ over $X(\Gamma_\Obf(\Ibf))$, with deck group isomorphic to  $\Gamma_\Obf(\Ibf)  \lmod \Gamma_\Obf = \SL(2,\obf /\Ibf).$  We are now prepared to state the theorem:
	\begin{thm}
		Let $\kbf, \obf, \Bbf$ be as above. Suppose further that $\Bbf$ has {\bf type number $1$}. Let $\Obf$ be a representative of the single conjugacy class of maximal orders in $\Bbf$. Then for any ideal $\Ibf$, not divisble by any prime over which $\Bbf$ is ramified,  the surface $X(\Gamma_\Obf(\Ibf))$  is absolutely spectrally rigid. 
	\end{thm}
	This theorem is the first, to my knowledge, which  produces infinitely many infinite families of Riemannnian manifolds which are demonstrably spectrally rigid. By carefully  choosing $\kbf,$ and $\Bbf,$ one can  apply this theorem to the principal congruence Hurwitz surfaces, partially confirming a conjecture of Alan Reid. 
	
\paragraph{Future projects:}
	
	To study the relationship among Dedekind zeta functions of number fields, number theorists study their factorizations into Artin $L$-functions associated to Galois representations representations. Following their lead, we introduce the analogous $L$ functions and study factorizations of Selberg's zeta function. Fix a compact negatively curved Riemannian manifold $M$, with fundamental group $\Gamma$. Let $\rho: \Gamma \to U(V)$ be a unitary representation on a finite dimensional Hilbert space $V$. Let
	\[	L_{M,\rho}(s) = \prod_{\gamma} \prod_{k=0}^\infty   \det ( \id_V -  \rho(\gamma)\exp^{-(s+k) \ell_M(\gamma) }  ) .\label{slf}\]
	These functions satisfy the so-called Artin-Takgai formalism: for a cover $M' \to M$ :
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item  For $\rho$ a unitary representation of $\Gamma' = \pi_1( M' ) \leq \Gamma$, 
		\[ L_{M',\rho} (s)  = L_{M, \ind_{\Gamma'}^{\Gamma_o} \rho} (s),
		\]  
		and for a unitary representation $\sigma$ of $\Gamma$,
		\[ L_{M,\sigma} (s)  = L_{M',\res_{\Gamma'}^{\Gamma}\sigma} (s). \]
		\item For a pair $\sigma, \sigma'$ of unitary representations of $\Gamma$, 
		\[ L_{M,\sigma \oplus \sigma' }(s) = L_{M,\sigma}(s) L_{M,\sigma'}(s) \]
	\end{enumerate}
	Applying the second property above, we may extend the function $L_{M,\cdot} (s)$ from the set ${\rm URep}(M)$ of unitary reps of $\pi_1(M)$ to the additive group ${\rm VURep}(\pi_1(M))$ of virtual unitary representations. Let $T(M)$ be some reasonable space of negatively curved metrics on $M$. Then we may view the assignment $(\mu,\rho) \mapsto L_{\mu,\rho}$ as a meromorphic-function valued function on the space $T(M) \times {\rm VURep(M)}$ which is a homomorphism in the second variable. 
	
	\begin{question}\label{q:multind}
		For which metrics $\mu$ is the homomorphism $L_{\mu, \cdot}$ injective? When it isn't injective, how large is its kernel? 
	\end{question} 
	
	This question has a meaningful analogue in number theory, whereat the answer is positive \cite{funakura1978}. It has as an immediate consequence that all arithmetically equivalent number fields arise from Gassman equivalence\cite{perlis1977}. A positive answer to \cref{q:multind} will show that all instances of isospectrality within a commensurability class must arise from Sunada's construction. 
	
	\begin{question}
		Fix a twist $\rho$. For which spaces of metrics $T(M)$ on $M$ is the function $L_{\cdot, \rho}$ injective on $T(M)$?
	\end{question}
	When $M$ is a compact surface of genus $g>1$, a natural candidate is the space $\Mcal_g$ of hyperbolic metrics.
	
	Inside of ${\rm VURep(M)}$ is the subgroup ${\rm FVUrep(M)}$ consisting of those virtual representations which admit a continuous extension to the profinite completion of $\pi_1(M)$). 
	\begin{question}\label{q:multind2}
		Supposing the answer to \cref{q:multind} is negative, must the kernel intersect ${\rm FVURep(M)}$ nontrivially? 
	\end{question}
	Now suppose that $M$ is an arithmetic hyperbolic $2$ or $3$ manifold of the form $ \mathbf{G}(k) \lmod \mathbf{G}(\Abb_k) / \prod_{\pfrak<\infty} \mathbf{G}(\Ocal_\pfrak) $  for some inner form $\mathbf{G}$ of $\SL_2$ and write $\Gamma $ for the corresponding  Fuchsian or Kleinian lattice in $G:= \mathbf{G}(k^\infty)$. The unitary representations of $\Gamma$ which factor through a finite \emph{congruence quotient} are precisely those which extend continuously to $K:= \prod_{\pfrak<\infty} \mathbf{G}(\Ocal_\pfrak)$. Write $\mathrm{CFVURep}(M)$ the subgroup of $\mathrm{FVURep}(M)$ generated by these representations.  
	\begin{question}\label{q:multind3}
		Supposing the answer to \cref{q:multind2} is negative, must the kernel intersect ${\rm CFVURep(M)}$ nontrivially? 
	\end{question}
	
	As mentioned in \cref{par:specrigidity}, Alan Reid proved that isospectral arithmetic hyperbolic $2$ and $3$ manifolds must be commensurable.  
	\begin{question}
		Let $M$ and $M'$ be isospectral nonarithmetic hyperbolic $2$ or $3$ manifolds
		$M$ and $M'$ be commensurable?  
	\end{question}
	If this is so, then if paired with a positive answer to \cref{q:multind}, one would have a complete characterization of isospectrality for such manifolds.

\begin{comment}
	In an application for a postdoctoral position, the
	teaching statement is not very important, so don’t waste much time on it. My
	opinion is that the teaching statement cannot help your application much or at all,
	but it might hurt your application if you write something really weird. (“When it
	comes to teaching, I believe it is better to be feared than to be loved.”) No one really
	cares what is your teaching philosophy. Just write a few conventional statements
	about what makes a good teacher (e.g. encouraging interaction with the students),
	and if you have received good eaching evaluations, then this is an opportunity to
	brag about them.

\section*{Core Principles}
I consider teaching to be an essential role of an active mathematician.  My teaching methodology is adaptive and prioritizes the learning objective of my audience.  I strive to make my classroom a safe, inclusive, and accessible environment, wherein students can freely, fully, and productively engage with the material. I make it a priority to be available to provide feedback to my students and to be sensitive to the needs of groups that are underrepresented in higher education. 
\section*{Teaching experience}
I have experience teaching in a variety of contexts: as a teaching assistant, as a lecturer, and as a mentor.
\subsection*{As a recitation leader:} I have served as a recitation leader for 21 sections of multivariable calculus, at Purdue University, over the course of 7 semesters. In this role, I supplemented the primary lecturer by addressing students' questions, and by developing students' problem-solving abilities through active participation and weekly quizzes.  I also actively encouraged students to probe beyond the course objectives and to think critically about challenging problems.  To this end I wrote several expository articles in response to specific students' questions, and made them freely available on my personal webpage. I supplemented several of these articles with animations, written in Mathematica, and made the source code freely accessible to students. 
\subsection*{As an instructor:} I have served as the instructor for a semester of two sections of  MA16010: Applied Calculus.  This course served as many of my students' first (and only) interaction with calculus. The topics that we covered include trigonometric and exponential functions; limits and differentiation, rules of differentiation, maxima, minima and optimization; curve sketching, integration, anti-derivatives, the fundamental theorem of calculus. Properties of definite integrals and numerical methods. The course concluded with applications to life, managerial, and social sciences.  In this role, I wrote, administered, and graded exams, and held weekly office hours.   
\newpage
\subsection*{As a mentor:}
I have served as the primary mentor for several reading courses for groups of undergraduate students. 
\paragraph{Differential geometry:} I lead two groups of students' independent studies into differential geometry; the first consisting of one undergraduate student in fall 2019, and the second with two undergraduates in spring semester of 2020. In both cases, we met weekly and discussed students' reading. We focused primarily on the textbook by DeCarmo, but also made use of several contemporary expository articles. Each week students solved a collection of problems, and presented their solutions. 
\paragraph{Abstract algebra:} In the fall of 2021, I lead two reading courses in abstract algebra for two groups of undergraduates. The first section consisted of 5 students, and was their first interaction with modern algebra. We worked through the first several chapters of Herstein's text. In our weekly meeting, students presented their solutions to problems of their choosing. The second section, consisting of 3 students, covered more advanced subjects; primarily focusing on Galois theory, with an aim towards algebraic number theory. The students in this section collaborated on a computational project, based in Sage, in which they formulated and verified certain statistical claims about quadratic and cubic extensions of the rational numbers.  
\paragraph{Representation theory:} I am currently leading an independent study with a single undergraduate into the basics of representation theory of finite groups. We are reading the standard texts by Fulton and Harris, and by Serre. We meet weekly, and the student is preparing as a term project an expository paper on the representation theory of $\operatorname{PSL}_2$ over finite fields.
\subsection*{As an organizer:}
\paragraph{Open mic night} From the summer of 2019 until March of 2020 I organized and hosted a weekly seminar, playfully called `open mic night.' This was a casual forum wherein graduate students could speak on topics about which they had been thinking, problems on which they were working, and concepts with which they were struggling.

\section{Arithmetic of indefinite quaternion algebras (following shimura)}
\label{sec:org8b2862a}
\subsection{Indefinite quaternion algebras}
\label{sec:orgef86b72}
Let \(F\) be a totally real field, with finite degree \(t\) over \(\Qbb\).
A quaternion algebra \(D\) over \(F\) is a central simple algebra over \(F\) such that \(|D:F|=4\).
Write \(R\) for the ring of integers of \(F\).
For a
prime ideal $\pfrak$ of \(R\), we let $R_\pfrak,$ $F_\pfrak,$ and \(D_\pfrak\) denote the $\pfrak$-adic completions of $R,$ $F,$ and \(D\) respectively.
We enumerate the \(t\) infinite places of \(F\) and denote them by \(\pfrak_{\infty,1},\cdots \pfrak_{\infty,t}\).
For \(i \leq t\) we write \(D^i\) for the completion of \(D\) at \(\pfrak_{\infty,i}\) so that
\[ D \otimes_\Qbb \Rbb \approx D^1 \times \cdots \times D^t \]
There are exactly two quaternion algebras over \(\Rbb\): the split algebra \(M_2(\Rbb)\), and the nonsplit algebra \(\Hcal\).
After reindexing, we may assume that for \(i \leq r\), we have \(D^i \approx M_2(\Rbb)\), and for \(r < i \leq t\), we have \(D^i \approx \Hcal\).
We say that \(D\) is \textbf{indefinite} if \(r>0\), and henceforth will assume that this is the case.
For an element \(a \in D\), we write its image in \(D^i\) by \(a^i\).
Thus, for each \(i \leq r\) we have \(a^i \in M_2(\Rbb)\) and \(a^i \in \Hcal\) for \(r < i \leq t\).
Note that the restrictions of the maps \((\cdot)^i\) to the central copy of \(F\) in  \(D\) yeild all of the embeddings of \(F\) into \(\Rbb\).
We write \(F^i\) for that image.
The algebras \(D\) (resp \(D_\pfrak,D^i\))  are each equipped with an involution \(a \mapsto a'\) characterized by the condition that \(F[a] \approx F[x]/ ((X-a)(X-a'))\) (resp.
\(F_\pfrak[a], \Rbb[a]\)).
Set, for each \(a \in D\) (resp, in \(D_\pfrak, D^i\))
\[ N(a) = aa' \quad \tr(a) = a + a'.
\]
For those \(i\leq r\), under the identification \(D^i \approx M_2(\Rbb)\), the maps \(N\) and \(\tr\) coincide with \(\det\) and \(\tr\) of matrices.
Letting \(N_{F/\Qbb}\) and \(\tr_{F/\Qbb}\) denote the absolute norm and trace maps on \(F\), we define absolute maps for \(a \in D\):
\[ N_{D/\Qbb} (a) = N_{F/\Qbb} (N(a)) \quad \tr_{D/\Qbb} (a) = \tr_{F/\Qbb} (\tr (a)) \]
\subsection{Ideal theory in \(D\)}
\label{sec:orgec6b45e}
An \(R\) (resp.
\(R_\pfrak\)) lattice in \(D\) (resp.
\(D_\pfrak\)) is a finitely generated $R$-module (resp.
$R_\pfrak$-module) \(M\) in \(D\) (resp.
\(D_\pfrak\)) such that \(FM = D\) (resp.
\(F_\pfrak M = D_\pfrak\)).
\subsubsection{consider introducing the set \(\Lcal(D)\) of lattices in \(D\), as well as its local counterparts.}
\label{sec:org7ff204b}
A subring of \(D\) containg \(R\) is an \textbf{order} if it is also an \(R\) lattice.
An order is maximal if its not properly contained in any other order.
Maximal orders exist, and any order is contained in a maximal one.
For an order \(\ofrak\), a lattice \(M\) in \(D\) is a right (resp.
left) $\ofrak$-ideal  if \(M \ofrak \subset M\) (resp.
\(\ofrak M \subset M\)).
We say \(M\) is a two-sided \(\ofrak\) ideal if it is both a left and a right $\ofrak$-ideal.
\subsection{The local theory, split case:}
\label{sec:org7edff72}
In this section \(F\) is a finite extension of \(\Qbb_p\) with ring of integers \(R\),  \(\pi\) a uniformizer, \(\ord\) the normalized valuation.
For an element \(y \in \GL(2,F)\) write \(\bar{y}\) for its image in \(\PGL(2,F)\).
Say \(y\) (or \(\bar{y}\) ) is \uline{even} if \(\ord(\det(y))\) is so, and odd otherwise.
Write \(F \times F\) as rwo vectors, and let \(M(2,F)\) act on it from the right.
A maximal \(R\) order \(\Ocal\) of \(M(2,F)\) takes the form
\[ \Ocal = \End_R(\Lambda) = \{ x \in M(2,F) : \Lambda x \subset \lambda \} \]
for some \(R\) lattice \(\Lambda \subset F \times F\), uniquely determined by \(\Ocal\) up to homothety.
Conversely, for any such lattice \(\Lambda\), the ring \(\End_R(\Lambda)\) is a maximal order.
Given two maximal orders \(\Ocal_1\) and \(\Ocal_2\), pick a lattice \(\Lambda_1 =  Rf +Rg\) so that \(\Ocal_1 = \End_R(\Lambda_1)\).
Then there is a lattice \(\Lambda_2\) such that \(\Ocal_2 = \End_R(\Lambda_2)\) and \(\Lambda_2 = R f + \pi^n R g  \leq \Lambda_1\).
The integer \(n=d(\Ocal_1,\Ocal_2)\) is uniquely determined by \(\Ocal_1\) and \(\Ocal_2\).

\section{pseudo-introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold. The eigenvalues of the Laplace operator $\Delta$ acting on $L^{2}(M)$ form a discrete sequence $0 =\lambda_{0}\leq \lambda_{1 }\leq \ldots $. The multiset of eigenvalues $\{\lambda_{i}\}$ is the \textbf{Laplace spectrum} of $M$. We say that two manifolds are \textbf{isospectral} if their Laplace spectra coincide. A manifold is \textbf{absolutely spectrally rigid} if the only manifolds to which it is isospectral are in fact isometric.
In this article, we prove the following
\begin{thm}
	Let $k$ be a totally real number field with ring of integers $R$, and $A$ a quaternion algebra over $k$ with type number $1$. Further, suppose that there is a unique real place of $k$ at which $A$ is unramified. Let $\Ocal$ be a maximal order in $A$, $\Ocal^{1}$ the multiplicative group of norm $1$ units. For an ideal $I$ in $R$, let $\Ocal^{1}(I) \leq \Ocal^{1}$ be the kernel of the reduction map. Denote by $\Gamma$ (resp. $\Gamma(I)$) the image of $\Ocal^{1}$ (resp. $\Ocal^{1}(I)$) in $\PSL(2,\Rbb)  = \Isom^{+}( \Hbb)$. Suppose that $I$ is not divisible by any prime in $R$ at which $A$ is ramified. Then the Riemann surface $\Gamma(I) \lmod \Hbb$ is absolutely spectrally rigid.
\end{thm}

\section{background spectral theory}
\subsection{The spectral theorem}% [TODO] cite LA TAKHTAJAN etudes
Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, and $A$ a closed, self-adjoint linear operator on $H$. The values
$\lambda \in \Cbb$ such for which the
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:resolvent}
	R_\lambda (A) = (A - \lambda \id )^\inv
\end{equation}
exists (as a bounded operator defined on all of $H$) is called the
\textbf{resolvent set} $\rho(A)$ of $A$. The resolvent set is open in $\Cbb$;
its complement $\sigma(A)$ is the \textbf{spectrum set} of $A$. If $A$ is a
self-adjoint operator, then $\sigma(A) \subset \Rbb$.
The spectral theorem of von Neumann associates to the self adjoint operator $A$
a projection-valued countably additive measure $\mathbf{E}$ on the
$\sigma$-algebra of borel subsets of $\Rbb$ such that $\Eloc(\emptyset) = 0 $
and $\Eloc(\Rbb) = \id$, that
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:specthm}
	D(A) = \{ f \in H : \int_{\Rbb} \lambda^2 \dop \ip{\Eloc_\lambda f }{f} \},
\end{equation}
and for $f \in D(A)$,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:specthm2}
	A f = \int_{\Rbb} \lambda \dop \Eloc_\lambda f,
\end{equation}
where $E_\lambda = \Eloc((-\infty, \lambda))$.
\subsection{Determinants}
In this section $C$ is a compact self-adjoint operator of trace class. Its
\textbf{characteristic determinant} is the entire function
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:fredet}
	p_C (\lambda) : \lambda \mapsto \det ( \id - \lambda C ) : = \prod_i (1 - \lambda_i \lambda)
\end{equation}
where the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $C$ are repeated according to their
multiplicity. Much like the characteristic polynomial of an operator on a finite
dimensional vectorspace, the characteristic determinant $p_C(\lambda)$ has
zeroes at $\lambda in \sigma(C)$ with order $\dim \ker (C - \lambda \id))$.
Now suppose that $C$ is invertible (so that, in particular, $p_\lambda(0) \neq
	0$) and set $A = C^\inv$. Then the formula
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:dlog}
	\frac{d}{d\lambda} \log \det (\id - \lambda C) = -\Tr R_\lambda (A)
\end{equation}
holds. When $R_\lambda(A)$ is an integral operator acting on some space $H =
	L^2(X)$ via an integral kernel $R_\lambda (x,y)$ on $X\times X$, the trace may be
computed via
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:trace}
	\Tr R_\lambda (A) = \int_X R_\lambda (x,x) \dop x.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Storing spectral data}
Now let $M$ be a compact connected, Riemannian manifold without boundary. Let
$\Delta$ be the laplace-beltrami operator on $M$. Its resolvent
$R_\lambda(\Delta) = (\Delta - \lambda \id)^\inv$ is compact and self-adjoint. We
consider its characteristic determinant: [TODO bloviate]
We associate to each $M$ some generating functions. For $t>0$, the \textbf{heat
	trace} of $M$ is
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:theta}
	\Theta_M(t) = \Tr (\exp(-t\Delta_M ) - \id ) = \sum_{\lambda \in \sigma(\Delta_M)} m_\lambda \exp (-t \lambda).
\end{equation}
For $s \in \Cbb$ the \textbf{resolvent determinant}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:zeta}
	Z_M(\lambda) = \det (1 - \lambda R_\Delta(-1))
\end{equation}
\begin{prop}
	Let $M$ and $M'$ be compact connected Riemannian manifolds without boundary.
	The following properties are equivalent
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $M$ and $M'$ are isospectral
		\item $\Theta_M = \Theta_{M'}$ (as functions on $\Rbb_{>0}$)
		\item $Z_M = Z_{M'}$ (as functions on $\Cbb$).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
[TODO bloviate]
\end{comment}
\section{Audible properties}
\subsection{Heat invariants}
Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold. Enumerate the spectrum of its Laplace-Beltrami operator as $0 = \lambda_0 < \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots $, where each eigenvalue is repeated according to its multiplicity. Pick an $L^2(M)$-orthonormal basis $\{ \phi_j  \}$ of corresponding eigenfunctions.  The \textbf{heat kernel} of $M$ is the function $K : \R_{>0} \times M \times M$ defined by
\begin{equation}
	K(t,x,y) = \sum_{j} e^{-t \lambda_j} \phi_j(x)\phi_j(y).
\end{equation}
\subsection{Scope: Riemannian manifolds}
\begin{thm}
	Volume is an audible property.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	[TODO: use asymptotics of $\Theta_M$]
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
	Dimension is an audible property.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	[TODO: use asymptotics of $\Theta_M$]
\end{proof}
\subsection{Scope: smooth, compact Riemannian surfaces}
\begin{thm}
	Suppose $\dim M = 2$ and that $M$ is smooth. The homeomorphism class of
	$M$ is audible.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	[TODO: gauss-bonnet]
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
	Suppose $\dim M = 2$, and that $M$ is smooth. The property of having constant
	curvature is audible.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	[TODO: GCB the metric of constant curvature minimizes topological
		entropy, which is a spectral invariant.]
\end{proof}
\subsection{Scope: Riemann surfaces}
\begin{thm}
	Suppose $M$ is a compact Riemann surface. Then arithmeticity is audible.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	[TODO: apply Takeuichi]
\end{proof}
\subsection{Scope: Arithmetic Riemann surfaces}
\begin{thm}
	Suppose $M$ is an arithmetic Riemann surface. The commensurability class
	of $M$ is audible. \end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	[TODO: apply Reid]
\end{proof}
% Let $(M,g)$ be a compact, connected Riemannian manifold without boundary. For a function $f\in
% C^2(M)$ define the \textbf{laplace-beltrami operator}
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:laplacian}
%   \Delta f = \delta d f,
% \end{equation}
% where $d : C^1(M) \to C^1 (T^* M)$ is the exterior derivative, and $\delta : C^1
% (T^* M) \to C^1(M)$ is its formal adjoint, defined relative to the Riemannian
% metric $g$ on $M$. The set of $\lambda \in \cbb$ such that the equation
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:spec}
%   \Delta f  = \lamba f  \quad \text{ for some } f\in L^2(M)
% \end{equation}
% has a solution is called the \textbf{eigenvalue set} of $M$. The
% \textbf{eigenvalue spectrum} of $M$ is the multiset of such $\lambda$, repeated
% according to their multiplicty $m_\lambda = \dim \ker (\Delta - \lambda \id)$.
% \subsection{Storing spectral data: traces and determinants}
\section{The proof}
Now let us fix all of data $(k, A , \Ocal, I)$ as in the main theorem. Sequentially applying the
theorems of the preceeding section, we may assume that a manifold $M$
isospectral to $\Gamma(I) \lmod \Hbb$ is of the form $M = \Lambda \lmod \Hbb$
for some subgroup $\Lambda$ of $\Gamma$ with the same index as  $\Gamma(I)$.
To prove the theorem, it suffices to show that $\Lambda$ is in fact conjugate
(in $A^\times$) to $\Gamma(I)$. To this end, we convert the problem into a local
one.
	[TODO: get to the prime power setting].
\section{Arithmetic Subgroups of algebraic groups}
A matrix group $G \leq \GL(n,\Cbb)$ is said to be \textbf{algebraic} if it consists of all invertible matrices whose coefficients annihilate some set of polynomials on $M(n,\Cbb)$. If this set of polynomials can be taken with coefficients in some subring $R \leq \Cbb$, then this group is said to be \textbf{defined over} R.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Base case}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $X$ denote the \textbf{Bruhat-Tits tree} for $\SL_2(k)$. The vertices of $X$ are homothety classes of lattices in $k^2$, and two vertices $x,y \in X$ are adjacent if there exist lattices $L_x \in x$ and $L_y \in y$ so that $L_y \leq L_x$ and $L_y/ \pi L_x$ is a $\kfrak$-line in $L_x / \pi L_x \approx \kfrak^2$. We write $d: X \times X \to \Zbb_{\geq 0}$ for the graph-theoretic distance function on $X$.
For a lattice $L \leq k^2$, we write $[L]$ for the vertex in $X$ corresponding to $L$. For a subset $A \subset X$ of vertices, write
\begin{align*}
	B(A,r) & = \{ y \in X: d(x,y)\leq  r,\, \forall x \in A\} \\
	S(A,r) & = \{ y \in X: d(x,y) = r \, \forall x \in A\}
\end{align*}
for the ball and sphere about $A$ of radius $r$, respectively.
A \textbf{geodesic} is a non-backtracking path in $X$.  The length of a geodesic $c$ is $\sup_{x,y \in c} d(x,y) \in \Zbb_{\geq 0} \cup \{\infty\}$. For vertices $x,y
	\in X$ write $[x,y]$ for the unique geodesic starting at $x$ and finishing at $y$.
For a subset $A \subset X$ we say that a vertex $x\in A$ is an {\bf interior point} of $A$ and write $x\in A^\inte$ if $B(x,1) \subset A$. Otherwise we say $x$ is a {\bf boundary point} of $A$ and write $x\in \partial A$. We say $x$ is an \textbf{extremal point} in $A$ if either: $A=\{x\}$ or $\card(S(x,1) \cap A) = 1$.
Let $\mathcal{G}= \SL_{2}$, and write  $G=\mathcal{G}(k)$  and $K= \mathcal{G}(R)$. $G$ acts on the set of lattices in $k^2$, and this action passes to one on $X$.  For a subgroup $H \leq G$, we write $X^H$ for its fixed point set on $X$. For a subset $A \subset X$,  and a subgroup $H\leq G$, we write $H_A$ for its (pointwise) stabilizer in $H$.
% \paragraph{A homothety section} Fix once and for all a root vertex $x_o \in X$, and a representative lattice $L_o \in x_o$. With this choice, we may associate to each vertex $x\in X$ a unique lattice $L_x \leq L_o$ satisfying the property:  $\pi^{d(x,x_o)} L_o \leq L_x \leq L_o$.
For each vertex $x$ and integer $n\geq 1$, we have a $R/\Pcal^{n}$-representation $\rho_{x} : G_{x} \to \SL(L_x / \pi^{n} L_{x}) \approx (R / \Pcal^{n})$
Upon picking a basis $e_{1},e_{2}$ for $L_{o}$ we may identify $G_{x_{o}}$ with $\SL_{2}(R)$. The action of $\SL_{2}(k)$ on $X$ has exactly two orbits. Letting $\alpha = \tbt{1}{0}{0}{p}$, the set $\{x_{o}, \alpha x_{o}\}$ constitutes a fundamental domain for this action. The respective stabilizers $G_{x_{o}}$ and $G_{\alpha x_{o}} = \alpha G_{x_{o}} \alpha^{\inv }$ are representatives of the two conjugacy classes of maximal compact subgroups.
The following lemma is standard:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:nball}
	For a vertex $x \in X$, there is a $G_{x}$ equivariant bijection between $n$-sphere $S(x,n)$ and cyclic $R/\Pcal^{n}$-submodules of $L_{x} / \pi^{n} L_{x}$. Using a basis for $L_{x}$, the latter set is naturally identified with $\Pbb^{1}(R/\Pcal^{n})$
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:XH}
	Let $H \leq G$ be a subgroup such that $X^{H}$ is nonempty.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item\label{item:XH1} For a subgroup $H\leq G$ and a vertex $x\in X^{H}$, the bijection in \cref{lem:nball} restricts to one between $H$-fixed vertices $X^{H}\cap S(x,n)$, and  $H$-stable $R/\Pcal^{n}$-submodules of $L_{x}/\pi^{n}L_{x}$.
		\item\label{item:XH2} For $x\in X^{H}$, one has $B(x,n) \leq X^{H}$ if and only if $H$ acts by scalars under $\rho_{x,n}$.
		\item\label{item:XH3} A vertex $x$ is a non-extremal boundary point of $X^{H}$ if and only if $\rho_{x,1}$ decomposes as a direct sum of (distinct) nontrivial characters.
		\item\label{item:XH4} A vertex $x$ is extremal in $X^{H}$ if and only if the $\mathfrak{k}$-representation $\rho_{x,1}$ is reducible but indecomposable.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\cref{item:XH1} and \cref{item:XH2} follow immediately from the definitions and the equivariance in \cref{lem:nball}.
	\cref{item:XH3}: Suppose $x$ is a nonextremal boundary point of $X^{H}$. There are then exactly two vertices $y,z \in X^{H}$ adjacent to $x$. Under the identification of $S(x,1)$ with $\Pbb^{1}(\kfrak)$, we see that $H$ must act as a group of hyperbolic transformations with common fixed points $y,z$.
	\cref{item:XH4} Suppose $x$ is extremal in $X^{H}$. Then $x$ has exactly one neighbor in $X^{H}$. Under the identification of $S(x,1)$ with $\Pbb^{1}(\kfrak)$, we find that $H$ must act as a group of parabolic transformations.
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:ribetgl2}[ref ribetGL2]
	Let $g\in \SL_{2}(R)$ and $x \in \partial X^{\langle g \rangle }$. For an integer $n>0$, the following are equivalent.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item\label{item:ribet1} The characteristic polynomial $p_{g}(T)$ is reducible mod $\Pcal^{n}$.
		%\item $\tr(g)^{2}-4$ is a square modulo $\Pcal^{n}$.
		\item\label{item:ribet2} There exists a geodesic of length $n$ based at $x$ and contained in $X^{\langle g \rangle}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Assuming \cref{item:ribet1}, pick $\alpha,\beta \in R$ such that $p_{g}(T) \equiv (T-\alpha)(T-\beta)$ mod $\Pcal^{n}$. Then since $x$ is a boundary point, $g$ does not act as a scalar on $L_{x}/\pi L_{x}$. Consequently, $L_{x}/\pi L_{x}$ is a cyclic $R[g]$ module. Pick a vector $v \in L_{x}$ such that $\{v, gv\}$ projects to a basis of $L_{x}/\pi L_{x}$. By Nakayama's lemma, $\{v,gv\}$ projects to a basis of $L_{x}/\pi^{n}L_{x}$.
	Let $w = (g-\beta)v$. Then, compute modulo $\Pcal^{n}$:
	\begin{align*}
		g w & \equiv (g^{2} -g \beta ) v                            \\
		    & \equiv ((\alpha +\beta )g -\alpha\beta g - g\beta  )v \\
		    & \equiv \alpha(g-\beta )v                              \\
		    & \equiv \alpha w
	\end{align*}
	Thus, the cyclic $R/\Pcal^{n}$-submodule of $L_{x}/\pi^{n}L_{x}$ spanned by $w$ is $g$ stable. The corresponding vertex lies in $X^{\langle g \rangle}$ and is at distance $n$ from $x$ as desired.
	Now assume that $y \in X^{\langle g \rangle }$ has $d(x,y)=n$. Pick a lattice
	$L_y$ representing $y$ with $\pi^n L_x < L_y <L_x$. Then $L_y$ projects to a
	$g$-stable free rank 1 $R/\Pcal^n$ submodule of $L_x / \pi^n L_y$ on which $g$
	must act by an element $\alpha \in (R/\Pcal^n)^\times$. It follows that
	$(t-\alpha)$ divides $p_g(t)$ modulo $\Pcal^n$, proving reducibility.
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
	Let $g\in \SL_{2}(R)$. For an integer $n >0$, the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\tr(g) = \pm 2 \mod \Pcal^{2n}$
		\item There is a point $x \in X^{g}$ such that $B(x,n)\subset X^{g}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	The argument is by induction on $n$.
	Base case: suppose $\tr(g)=2 \pm 2 \mod \Pcal^{2}$. By \cref{prop:ribetgl2} there is a geodesic $\gamma$ of length $2$ contained in $X^{g}$.  Conjugating by an element of $\GL_{2}(k)$ if needed, we may assume that $\gamma$ takes the form $(y, x_{o},z)$. Since $g$ has two fixed points in the $1$ neighborhood of $x_{o}$, it acts semisimply on $L_{x_o}/\pi L_{x_{o}}$ say with eigenvalues $\alpha,\beta \in R/\Pcal$. These eigenvalues must satisfy $\alpha + \beta =\pm 2 \mod \Pcal$ and $\alpha \beta = 1  \mod \Pcal$, but then $g$ acts as $\pm \id$ and the claim follows.
	Suppose now that for all $k<n$ that $\tr(g) = \pm 2 \mod \Pcal^{2k}$ iff and only if $g$ fixes some $k$ ball in $X$. Let $\tr(g) = \pm 2 \mod \Pcal^{2n}$. Applying \cref{prop:ribetgl2}  as before, there is some geodesic $\gamma$ passing through $x_{o}$ of length $2n$ which is fixed pointwise by $g$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Some projective geometry}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $F$ be a field, let $V$ be a two dimensional vectorspace over $F$. The \textbf{projective line} over $F$ is the set of $F$-lines in $V$. There are several useful coordinate systems that one can put on $\Pbb^{1}(F)$.
The first system requires no choices: the association of a nonzero vector $v$ with the $F$-line that it spans yeilds a surjection $V\setminus \{0\} \to \Pbb^{1}(F)$. The multiplicative group $F^{\times}$ acts transitively on the fibers, yeilding our first identification: $\Pbb^{1}(F) = F^{\times}\rmod (V - \{0\})$
A bijection $\Pbb^{1}(F) \to \Pbb^{1}(F)$ is a \textbf{projective transformation} if it lifts to a linear automorphism of $V$. Write $G'$ for the group of projective transformations.
\begin{lemma}
	A nonidentity projective transformation can have at most $2$ fixed points on $\Pbb^{1}(F)$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The points in $\Pbb^{1}(F)$ fixed by $g$ correspond to eigenlines of its lifts to $\GL(V)$. Since $V$ is two dimensional, it supports at most two linearly independent lines.
\end{proof}
We classify nonidentity transformations accordingly:
\begin{itemize}
	\item say $g$ is \textbf{hyperbolic} if it fixes two points on $\Pbb^{1}(F)$
	\item say $g$ is \textbf{parabolic} if it fixes exactly one point on $\Pbb^{1}(F)$
	\item say $g$ is \textbf{elliptic} if it fixes no points in $\Pbb^{1}(F)$.
\end{itemize}
The following lemma demonstrates how to determine the category of a projective transformation in terms of its lifts. For a linear transformation $\tilde{g} \in \GL(V)$ write $p_{\tilde{g}}(T) = \det(\tilde{g}-T \id) \in F[T]$ for its characteristic polynomial and $\delta(\tilde{g}) = \tr(g)^{2} -4 \det(g)$ for its discriminant.
\begin{lemma}
	Let $g$ be a nonidentity projective transformation.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $g$ is hyperbolic if and only if any lift $\tilde{g}$ is semisimple and diagonalizable over $F$, for any lift $\tilde{g}$. This is so  if and only if $\delta(\tilde{g})  \in (F^{\times})^{2}$.
		\item $g$ is parabolic if and only if $\tilde{g}$ is not semisimple for any lift $\tilde{g}$. This is so if and only if $\delta(\tilde{g})= 0$.
		\item $g$ is parabolic if and only if $\tilde{g}$ is not semisimple for any lift $\tilde{g}$. This is so if and only if $\delta(\tilde{g}) \in F^\times \setminus (F^{\times})^{2}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

% The main theorem of this section is
% \begin{thm}
% 	Let $G \leq	\SL_2(R)$ be a subgroup satisfying $\tr(g)^2 - 4 \in
% 	\Pcal^{2n}$ for all $g\in G$. Then there exists a $g\in \GL_2(k)$ such that
% 	$gGg^\inv \leq K(n) = \{g \in \SL_2(R) : g - \id \in \Pcal^n
% 	M_2(R)\}$.
% \end{thm}
% \begin{prop}
% 	For a subgroup $H \subseteq \GL_2(k)$, fix a vertex $x\in X^G$ and let $L_x \in
% 	x$ be a representative lattice. There is a bijection between
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item Vertices $x\in X^G$ with $d(x,y)=n$, and
% 		\item $G$-stable, rank-1, free $R/\Pcal^n$ submodules of $L_x / \pi^n
% 			L_x$.
% 	\end{enumerate}
% 	Given a point $y\in X^G$ with $d(x,y)=n$, the corresponding submodule of $L_x
% 	/ \pi^n L_x$ is given by $L_y / \pi^n L_x$ where $L_y$ is chosen so that
% 	$\pi^n L_x < L_y < L_x$.
% \end{prop}
% \begin{prop}
% 	For a subgroup $G \subseteq \GL_2(K)$, fix a vertex $x\in X^G$ and a representative $G$-stable lattice $L_x \in x$. Then $G$ acts on $L_x /\pi^r L_x$ by scalars if and only if $B(x,r) \subseteq X^G$.
% \end{prop}
% For an element $g\in M_2(k)$, we write $p_g(t)= \det(g -t \id) \in k[t]$ for its characteristic polynomial.
% \subsection{Elementwise results}
% 	Our first lemma characterizes those elements of $\GL_2(k)$ which fix some vertex. \begin{lemma}
% 	Let $g\in \GL_2(k)$. Then $X^g$ is nonempty if and only $p_g(t) \in R[t]$.
% \end{lemma}
% 	\begin{proof}
% 			The $R$ module $R[g]$ is finitely generated if and only if $p_g(t) \in R[t]$. In this case, $R[g]$ is a a $g$ stable lattice in $k[g] \approx k^2$.
% 	\end{proof}
% \begin{cor}
%   Suppose $g,h \in \GL_2(k)$ satisfy $X^g, X^h \neq \varnothing $. Then $X^{g} \cap X^{h} = X^{\langle g,h\rangle} \neq \varnothing $ if and only if $p_{gh}(t) \in R[t]$.
% \end{cor}
% \begin{cor}
%   For a subgroup $G\leq \GL_2(k)$, $X^G\neq \varnothing $ if and only if $p_g(t) \in R[t]$ for all $g\in G$.
% \end{cor}
% The next lemma characterizes elements $g\in \GL_2(k)$ for which fix a geodesic of length $n$.
% \begin{lemma}
%    Let $g\in \GL_2(k)$ and $x \in \partial X^g$ be an boundary point. Then there exists a vertex $y \in X^g$ with $d(x,y) = n $ if and only if $p_g(t)$ is reducible mod $\Pcal^n$.
% \end{lemma}
% 	\begin{proof}
% 		Let $\alpha,\beta \in R$ satisfying $p_g(t) \equiv (t - \alpha)(t-\beta) \mod \Pcal^n$. Since $x$ is a boundary point of $X^g$, the action of $g$ is nonscalar on $L_x/\pi L_x$. Thus, we may pick a vector $u \in L_x$ such that $\{u,gu\}$ projects to a basis of $L_x/\pi L_x$. By Nakayama's lemma, we may assume that $\{u,gu\}$ projects to an $R/\Pcal^n$-basis for $L_x / \pi^n L_x$.
% 		By the cayley-hamilton theorem, the vector $v = (g-\beta ) u$ satisfies $g v \equiv \alpha v \mod \Pcal^n$. Let $L = R v + \pi^n L_x$. Then the vertex $y=[L]$ lies in $X^g$ and satisfies $d(x,y)=n$ as desired.
% 	\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
	For a subgroup $H \leq \SL(2,k)$, suppose $X(H)$ contains a geodesic segment $[y,z]$ of length two. Denote its midpoint $x$. Then there exists a character $\chi : H \to \mathfrak{f}^{\times}$ such that $\rho_{x} \approx \chi \oplus \chi^{\inv}$.

\section{Invariant trace fields and quaternion algebras}
The following definitions are standard (and can be found in, say, \cite[Ch. 3]{maclachlanArithmeticHyperbolic3Manifolds2003}).
\begin{definition}\label{def:trace field}
	Let $\Gamma  \leq \SL(2,\Cbb)$. The \textbf{trace field of $\Gamma$} is the field
	\begin{align*}
		\Qbb(\Tr(\Gamma)):= \Qbb( \Tr(\gamma) : \gamma \in \Gamma).
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:quat alg}
	Suppose $\Gamma \leq \SL(2,\Cbb)$ is a non-elementary subgroup (equiv. acts irreducibly, equiv. is not virtually solvable). Then the $\Q(\Tr(\Gamma)$-linear span of $\Gamma$ in $M(2,\Cbb)$ is a quaternion algebra over $\Qbb(\Tr(\gamma))$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{definition}\label{def:quat alg}
	For non-elementary $\Gamma \leq \SL(2,\Cbb)$, the call the algebra in \ref{lemma:quat alg} the quaternion algebra of $\Gamma$.
\end{definition}
\section{Arithmetic Fuchsian and Keinian groups and their associated hyperbolic manifolds}
For details on quaternion algebras and their arithmetic, see \cite{maclachlanArithmeticHyperbolic3Manifolds2003}.
An arithmetic lattice $\Gamma$ in a Lie group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$ commensurable to one of the form $\bf{G}(\Zbb)$ for some semisimple linear algebraic group $\bf{G}$ defined over $\Zbb$ such that $\bf{G}(\Rbb) \approx G$. Arithmetic Fuchsian (resp. Kleinian) groups are those of this form where $G = \PSL(2,\Rbb)$ (resp $G= \PSL(2,\Cbb)$). More precisely,
\begin{definition}[Arithmetic Fuchsian (Kleinian) groups]\label{def:arithFuchsianKleinian}
	Let $k$ be a totally real number field (resp. a number field with exactly one place) and let $A$ be a quaternion algebra over $A$ which is ramified over all real places except one (resp. ramified over all real places). Let $\rho$ be a $k$-embedding of $A$ in $M(2,\Rbb)$ (resp. $M(2,\Cbb)$, and let $\Ocal$ be an order in $A$. Then a subgroup of $\PSL(2,\Rbb)$ (resp. $\PSL(2,\Cbb)$) is an \textbf{arithmetic fuchsian} (resp. \textbf{Kleinian})\textbf{ group} if it is commensurable with some such $P\rho(\Ocal^1)$.
\end{definition}
We say that  hyperbolic $2$ (or $3$) manifold is arithmetic if it is isometric to one of the form $\Gamma \lmod G \rmod K$ where $G= \PSL(2,\Rbb)$ and $K = \PSO(2)$ (or $G= \PSL(2,\Cbb)$ and $K = \PSU(2)$) (TODO: discuss an intrinsic characterization via developing maps and uniformization/geometrization).
%\subsection{The bruhat tits tree associated to $\PGL(2,K)$:}\label{sec:the bruhat tits}
The \textbf{Bruhat-Tits tree} $\Xcal$ of $\PGL(2,K)$ is the graph whose vertices are homothety classes of lattices in $K^2$. Vertices $x,x' \in \Xcal$ are adjacent if there are representative lattices $L \in x$ and $L' \in x'$ such that $L' < L$ and $L/L' \approx k$.  The graph $\Xcal$ is a $q+1$ regular tree, where $q = \operatorname{card}(k)$ (see \cite{serreTrees2003}).
Let $d$ denote the distance on $\Xcal$ induced by its graph structure. For a vertex $x$ and a lattice $L$ representing $x$ there is a canonical identification between the set of vertices of distance $d$ from $x$ and the set of $\Ocal/\pi^d \Ocal$-free rank-1 submodules of $L / \pi^d L$.
Note that $\GL(2,K)$ acts on the vertices of $\Xcal$ as graph automorphisms, and that this action factors through the quotient $\PGL(2,K)$.
For a subset $S$ of $\GL(2,K)$, write $\Xcal(S)$ for the set of vertices fixed by each element of $S$. Note, as in \cite[Sec. 3.1]{bellaicheSousgroupesGLArbres2014}, that if $G$ is the group generated by $S$, then $\Xcal(S) = \Xcal(G)$. Consequently, $\Xcal(S)$ is a connected subtree (possibly empty) for any $S$.
For  a set $C\subset \Xcal$ of vertices, write $\Gamma(C)$ for the (pointwise) stabilizer of $C$ in $\GL(2,K)$.
% vertex $x$ is in $\Xcal(S)$ if for some (hence any) lattice $L$ representing $x$, one has $sL \leq L$ for all $s \in S$.
%	\subsection{The modular representations associated to a fixed vertex}\label{sec:the modular representations} For a vertex $x\in \Xcal(S)$ and representative lattice $L\in x$, the action of each $s\in S$ on $L$ preserves the sublattices $\pi^n L$, hence acts on the finite quotient $L/\pi^n L$.
%
%\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:integral-traces}
%		For a subgroup $G \leq \SL(2,K)$, the following properties are equivalent:
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item $\Xcal(G)$ is nonempty.
%			\item $\Tr(g) \in \Ocal$ for all $g\in G$.
%			\item $G$ is $\GL(2,K)$-conjugate to a subgroup of $\GL(2,\Ocal)$.
%			\item The orbit of some vertex $x\in \Xcal$ under $G$ is finite
%			\item The orbit of any vertex $x\in \Xcal$ is finite
%			\item $G$ is relatively compact in $\SL(2,K)$
%			\item $G$ is contained in a compact subgroup of $\SL(2,K)$
%			\item $G$ is bounded as a subset of $M(2,K)$.
%	\end{itemize}
%		\end{lemma}
\1
% A \textbf{geodesic segment} in $\Xcal$ is an isometric image of a (possibly infinite) interval $I \subseteq \Zbb$ in $\Xcal$. Since $\Xcal$ is a tree, there is a unique directed geodesic $[x,y]$ between any two vertices $x,y$. A subset $S \subset \Xcal$ is \textbf{convex} if, for all pairs $x,y \in S$, one has $[x,y] \subset S$. A vertex $x$ in a convex set $S$ is extremal if either it has only one neighbor in $S$, or $S$ is a singleton,  in which case its only vertex is extremal. For any set its \textbf{convex hull} is the smallest convex set  containing it.
\begin{lemma}(\cite[Lemma 2.2]{ophirRIBETLEMMAGL22021})
	Let $x \in X(S)$ and fix a representative $L \in x$. There is a bijection between
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Points $y \in X(S)$ with $d(x,x') = n$;
		\item Free rank 1 $\Ocal/ \pi^n \Ocal$ submodules of $L/\pi^n L$ which are stable under $S$.
	\end{itemize}
	Given a point $x' \in X(S)$ with $d(x,x')=n$, the corresponding submodule of $L/\pi^n L$ is given by $L'/\pi^n L$ where $L'$ is a lattice representing $y$, chosen so that $ \pi^n L \leq L' \leq L$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}(\cite[Lemma 2.6]{ophirRIBETLEMMAGL22021})
	Fix $x\in \Xcal(G)$, and $r\geq 1$. Then $G$ acts on $L_x / \pi^r L_x$ by scalars if and only if $B(x,r) \subset \Xcal(G)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{definition}
	For a connected subset $C$ of $\Xcal$, say that a vertex $x \in C$ is a \textbf{boundary point} of $C$ if $B(x,1) \subset C$.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:elementwise}
	\cite[Cor. 2.20]{ophirRIBETLEMMAGL22021} Let $g\in M(2,\Ocal)$ and $x$ be boundary point of $\Xcal(\{g\})$. Let $n$ be a positive integer. The following are equivalent:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $P_g(t)$ is reducible modulo $\pi^n$.
		\item There exists a point $y \in X(\{g\})$ with $d(x,y) = n$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
Sketch of proof:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Overall claim: suppose $G$ is a subgroup of $\SL(2,K)$ such that $\Tr(G) = 2 + \Pcal^{2n}$. Then $G$ is $\GL(2,K)$ conjugate to a subgroup of $K(\Pcal^n) = \{ g \in \SL(2,\Ocal) : g = \id \mod \Pcal^{n}\}$.
	\item Base case: take $n=1$ and suppose that $\tr(g) = 2 \mod \Pcal^{2}$ for all $g\in G$.
	      \subitem Claim: there is a geodesic segment of length two contained in $X(G)$.
	      \subitem Proof: We know that $X(G)$ is nonempty, since $\tr(g) \in \Ocal$ for all $g\in G$. Pick $v \in X(G)$, and pick a representative lattice $L \in v$,  set $\overline{L} = L / \Pcal L$, and  obtain a representation $\bar{\rho}: G \to \SL(2,\Ocal/\Pcal) < \Aut(\overline{L})$. Since the characteristic polynomial of $\bar{\rho}(g)$ is $(x-1)^2 \in \Ocal /\Pcal [x]$ there exists $\bar{\rho}(G)$ invariant line $\overline{L_0} \leq \overline{L}$. Then the unique lift $L_0 \leq L$ containing $\Pcal L$ represents a vertex $v_0 \in X$ which is fixed by $G$.

%	A lattice in $V$ is a finitely generated $\Ocal$ sub-module which generates $V$ as a $K$-vectorspace. Let $\Lcal=\Lcal(V)$ denote the set of lattices in $V$. The action of $K^\times$ on $V$ induces an action on $\Lcal$. The orbit of a lattice under this action is its \textbf{homothety} class, and we let $X= K^\times \rmod \Lcal$ denote the set of such classes.

%\section{Identifying the spectra for arithmetic surfaces} %Let $k$ be a field. We write $\pl_k$ for its set of places, $\pl_k^\infty$ for those dividing $\infty$, and %$\pl_k^f$ for those dividing a finite prime. For any $\nu \in \pl_k$, write $k_\nu$ for the corresponding completion.  %Let $\qa_k$ denote the set of isomorphism classes quaternion algebras over $k$. If $k$ is a local %field, then there are at most two elements of $\qa_k$. If $k \neq \Cbb$, then there are exactly two: a divison algebra %$\Hcal_k$ and the split algebra $M(2,k)$. If $k = \Cbb$ then there is only the split algebra $M(2,k)$.  %Now suppose $k$ is a number field and take $A \in \qa_k$. For $ \nu \in \pl_k$ let $A_\nu = A \otimes k_\nu$. By the %preceeding paragraph, for each place $\nu$, there are at most two options for $A_\nu$ up to isomorphism. We say that $A$ %is ramified at $\nu$ (and write $\nu \in \ram_A$) if $A_\nu$ is the divison algebra $\Hcal_\nu = \Hcal_{k_\nu}$; %otherwise we say $A$ is unramified at $\nu$ if $A_\nu$ is $M(2,k_\nu)$. The following lemma provides a complete %description of $\qa_k$ via the map $A \mapsto \ram_A$. %\begin{lemma} Let $k$ be a number field. %\begin{enumerate} %\item If $A,B \in \qa_k$ satisfy $\ram_A = \ram_B$ then $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic. %\item For any $A \in \qa_k$, the set $\ram_A$ is finite and has even cardinality. %\item For any finite subset $S$ of $\pl_k$ of even cardinality, there exists unique $A \in \qa_K$ such that $S = %\ram_A$. %\end{enumerate} %\end{lemma} %For each $A \in \qa_k$, let $\Ord_A$ denote the set of orders in $A$: $\Ocal\in  \Ord_A$  if $\Ocal$  is a finitely %generated $R_k$ unital subalgebra $A$, of maximal rank. Let $\MOrd_A$ denote the set of orders in $A$ which are maximal %with respect to containment. The following lemma indicates the relevance of $\Ord_A$ and $\MOrd_A$ to geometry: %\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:A1} %Let $k$ be a number field, $A \in \qa_k$ a quaternion algebra over $k$, and $\Ocal \in \Ord_A$ an order. The image of %$\Ocal^1$ is an irreducible lattice in the semisimple lie group $\prod_{\nu \in \pl_k^\infty} A_\nu^1 \approx %\SL(2,\Rbb)^r \times \SL(2,\Cbb)^s \times \SU(2)^t$. If $\Ocal  \in \MOrd_A$ is a maximal order, then its image is a %maximal lattice. %\end{lemma} %It is straightforward to see that the conclusion of lemma \ref{lemma:A1} remains true if one projects to the noncompact %factors (i.e. if one restricts the product to only unramified archimedian places). %We now restrict to totally real number fields $k$, and let $\qae_k$ denote the set of $A \in \qa_k$ satisfying the so-called: %\begin{quote}{Eichler condition:} %$A$ is split at exactly one real place of $k$. %\end{quote} %Applying lemma \ref{lemma:A1} to orders $\Ocal \in \Ord_A$ for quaternion algebras $A \in \qae_k$, we obtain the %archaetypal examples of {\bf arithmetic fuchsian groups}.  %\begin{definition}[arithmetic fuchsian group] %Let $P: \SL(2,\Rbb) \to \PSL(2,\Rbb)$ denote the canonical projection. We say that a lattice $\Gamma \leq %\PSL(2,\Rbb)$ is an arithmetic fuchsian group if it is commensurable (in the wide sense) with $P(\rho(\Ocal^1))$ for %some order $\Ocal \in \Ord_A$ for some quaternion algebra $A \in \qae_k$ for some totally real number field $k$. %\end{definition} %We let$\ArFu$ denote the set of arithmetic fuchsian groups.  %%Some comments are in order. Suppose $\Gamma$ is an arithmetic fuchsian group which is commensurable to $P(\rho(\Ocal^1))$ and $P(\rho'(\Ocal'^1))$ for $(\Ocal,A,k)$ and $(\Ocal',A',k')$ as above. Then in fact, $k\approx k'$ and $A \approx A'$. It follows that $\ArFu = \sqcup_{k{\rm totally real}} \sqcup_{A \in \qae_k} \ArFu(A)$. %\newpage  %\section{Notation} %If $S$ is a ring, let $S^\times$ denote the group of multiplicatively invertible elements  in $S$. %$k$ will be a nonarchimedean local field, with normalized valuation $\ord : k \to \Zbb \cup \{ \infty \}$. We let $R$ %denote its ring of integers $\wp$ %its maximal ideal, and $ \varpi $ a uniformizer (chosen once and for all) of $\wp$. We write $\mathfrak{f} = R/\Pcal$ for the residue field, and $q$ its cardinality, and $p$ its characteristic. We operate throughout with the assumption that %As a rule, boldface letters denote algebraic groups, the corresponding fraktur letters denote their Lie algebras, and the corresponding regular letters denote their groups of rational points. %For a group $H$ equipepd with a filtration by subgroups $H_r$ for $r \in \Zbb_{\geq 0}$, we extend the filtration to $r %\in \Rbb_{\geq 0}$ by setting $H_r = H_{\lceil r \rceil }$. For $r\in \Rbb_{\geq 0}$, wwe set $H_{r+} = \cup_{s > r} %H_s$.  %We let $\mathbf{G} = \SL_2$ and take  the diagonal subgroup $\mathbf{A}$ as our fixed maximal $k$ split torus in %$\mathcal{G}$. We let $X(T) = \Hom(\mathbf{A}, \Gbb_m)$, which in this case is isomorphic to $\Zbb$ . We pick the root %$\alpha : \tbt{a}{0}{0}{d} \mapsto a/d$ as a generator, and let $\mathbf{U}$ be the corresponding root subgroup, $\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{U}$ the corresponding Borel. %We write $\Ad : G \to \Aut(\gfrak)$ for the adjoint representation $\Ad(g) X = g X g^\inv $, and $\ad : \gfrak \to %\End(\gfrak)$ its differential $ \ad (Y)X = [X,Y] = XY-YX$.  We will consider the characteristic polynomial for these %actions:  %We let $K = \Gbf(R)$ denote a maximal compact open subgroup of $G= \Gbf(k)$.  %\newpage %\section{Some filtrations} %The group $k^\times$ is equipepd with a canonical filtration, defined by setting $k^\times_0 = R^\times $ and for $n %>0$, setting $k^\times_n = 1 + \mathcal{P}^n$. We transport this filtration to $A$ via \emph{either} of the two %isomorphisms $A \approx k^\times$.    %\newpage %\section{The dumbest possible argument} %Let  $K=\SL(2,\Ocal)$ and for $n>0$ let $\pi_n : K \to G(\wp^n):=\SL(2,\Ocal/\Pcal^n)$ be the reduction map.

Applying part  of claim \ref{theorem:conj}, we may assume $G$ preserves the lattice $L = \Ocal \oplus \Ocal \leq k^2$ and by linearity its sublattices $\wp^n L$.  Let $\rho_n : G \to G(n) \leq \Aut(L/\pi^n L)$ be the resulting represention over $\Ocal/\Pcal^n$.  By assumption, for all $g\in G$, the polynomial $P_g (x) = x^2 - \tr(g) x + 1$ is reducible modulo $\Pcal^n$. Applying part \ref{item:residualB} of claim \ref{claim:residual}, there exists an element $\gamma \in \GL(2,\Ocal/\Pcal^n)$ so that $\gamma \rho(G) \gamma^\inv \leq B(n)$. Then for any lift $\tilde{\gamma}$ of $\gamma$ in $\GL(2,\Ocal)$, we have $\tilde{\gamma} G \tilde{\gamma}^\inv \leq K_0(n)$. %For each $g$, pick $\alpha_g,\beta_g \in \Ocal^n$ such that $P_g(x) \equiv (x-\alpha_g)(x -\beta_g)$ modulo $\Pcal^n$.

Then applying part we may assume that $G$ is a subgroup of $K_1(2n)$. Letting $\alpha= \tbt{\pi^n}{0}{0}{1}$, write $g = \tbt{1+a' \pi^{2n}}{b}{c'\pi^{2n}}{1+d'\pi^{2n}}$ with $a',b,c',d'\in \Ocal$. Then $\alpha g \alpha^\inv = \tbt{1+a' \pi^{2n}}{b\pi^n}{c'\pi^{n}}{1+d'\pi^{2n}} \in K(n)$. %\end{itemize} %\end{proof}   %%\section{The projective, affine, and linear line over a field} %%[Fuck it, lets go full  AG.] %%

%\section{A structural description of $\PGL_2$ and its subgroups}
%\begin{definition}[(Linear line)]
%A \textbf{line} $L$ is a one dimensional vectorspace over $F$. In particular, $L$ is equipped with an element $0_L$, a group law $+_L$, and a compatible action $\cdot_L : F^\times \to \Aut(L,+_L)$. Write $\GL(L)$ for the group of linear automorphisms of a line. 
%\end{definition}
%\begin{remark}
%The automorphism group of a line acts neither transitively nor effectively on the whole line: the origin $0_L$ is fixed by any linear automorphism.  Rather, $\GL(L)\approx F^\times$  acts simply and transitively on the punctured line $L\setminus\{0_L\}$. 
%\end{remark}
%\begin{definition}[(Affine line)]
%An \textbf{affine line} $A$ over $F$ is a set on which a line $L$ acts simply and transitively. A map $A \to A$ is an \textbf{affine transformation} if it commutes with the action of $L$ on $A$. Write $\Aff(A)$ for the group of affine automorphisms of $A$. 
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}[(Projective line)]
%For a field $F$, let $\Pbb^1 = \Pbb^1(F) = F^\times \lmod (F^2 - \{ 0 \})$ denote the \textbf{projective line} over $F$. A bijection $g : \Pbb^1(F) \to \Pbb^1(F)$ is a \textbf{projective transformation} if $g$ lifts to a linear transformation of $F^2$. The automorphism group $G$ of $\Pbb^1(F)$ can thus be identified with $\PGL(2,F) = F^\times \lmod \GL(2,F)$. For a vector $(x,y) \in F ^2$ we let $ [x;y]$ denote the line $F^\times (x,y) \in \Pbb^1$. 
%\end{definition}
%\subsection{Coordinate patches}
%The projective line $\Pbb^1(F)$ is covered by two copies of the affine line via the maps $\phi_0, \phi_\infty : \Abb^1(F) = F \to \Pbb^1$ sending $x \in F$ to the lines $[x;1]$ and $F^\times (x,1)$ respectively.     
%Their images intersect along a copy of $\Gbb_m(F)= F^\times$ glued along the map $x \mapsto 1/x$.  In particular, $\Pbb ^1 \setminus  \phi_0(F) = \{\phi_\infty(0)\}$. Denoting the latter point by $\infty$, we obtain the familiar description $\Pbb^1 = F \sqcup \{ \infty \}$. The mapping $w:x \mapsto 1/x$ extends to an involution of $\Pbb^1$ by defining $w(0)= 1/0 = \infty$ and $w(\infty) = 1/\infty =0$. 
%\begin{lemma}
%This extension $w : \Pbb^1 \to \Pbb^1$ is a projective transformation.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%It is represented by any involutive linear transformation which takes the affine line $(0,1)+F(1,0)$ to the line $(1,0)+F(0,1)$ while fixing their point of intersection $(1,1)$: for example $\tbt{0}{-1}{1}{0}$. 
%\end{proof}
%\subsection{Homogeneous descriptions}
%The automorphism group $G$ acts highly transitively on $\Pbb^1$, yielding several important descriptions, as in the following
%\begin{lemma}
%The subgroup $G_0$  (resp. $G_\infty$) of $G$ that preserves the image of $\phi_0$ (resp. $\phi_\infty)$ is the pointwise stabilizer of $\infty$ (resp. $0$). The following diagram commutes:

%\item $G_0$ (resp. $G_\infty$) acts transitively on $\phi_0(F)$ (resp. on $\phi_\infty(F)$) by affine transformations, yielding an isomorphism $G_\infty \approx G_0 \approx \Aff(1,F)$.
%\item The stabilizer in $G_0$ of $0$ coincides with the stabilizer in $G_\infty$ of $\infty$, and is consequently their intersection.
%\item The intersection $A:=G_0 \cap G_\infty$ is isomorphic to $\Gbb_m(F)= F^\times$.             
%\item Picking $\phi_0(0)$ (resp. $\phi_\infty(0)$) as the origin in $\phi_0(F)$ (resp. in $\phi_\infty(F)$), $A$ acts as linear transformations on $\phi_0(F)$ (resp. $\phi_\infty(F)$), hence simply transitively on their intersection $\phi_0(F) \cap \phi_\infty(F)$. 
%\item $A$ is a normal subgroup of $G_0$ and $G_\infty$. The sequences

%\begin{remark}
%The choice of $0$ and $\infty$ in the preceding discussion was arbitrary. In fact, the map $x \mapsto G_x = \Stab_G(x)$ from $\Pbb^1(F)$  to the set of subgroups of $G$ intertwines the action of $G$ on $\Pbb^1$ by projective transformations and the action of $G$ on the set of its subgroups by conjugation. In particular, for any pair of distinct points $x,y \in \Pbb^1(F)$, one obtains a covering by affine lines, preserved by subgroups $G_x$ and $G_y$, on which they act by affine transformations. Their intersection $G_x\cap G_y$ acts on affine line linearly, simply and transitively on their intersection.

\section{Reductive Groups}
Let $G$ be a connected algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $k$.  Say that $G$ is semisimple if the only smooth connected solvable normal subgroup of $G$ is trivial, and reductive if the only smooth connected unipotent normal subgroup of $G$ is trivial. Any unipotent group over an algebraically closed field has a composition series in which each quotient is isomorphic to $\Gbb_a$. For reductive $G$, the inner action of $G$ on itself induces a homomorphism of $k$-group functors $G \to \Aut(G)$, and automorphisms of $G$ can be differentiated to elements of $\Aut(\gfrak)$: this is the adjoint action of $G$ on $\gfrak$.
A representation of a torus $T$ on a vectorspace $V$ is tantamount to a grading of $V$ by $X(T) = \Hom(T,\Gbb_m)$. When $T$ is a (maximal) torus  in reductive $G$ and $V = \gfrak$, the decomposition is
\begin{align*}
  \gfrak = \tfrak \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha \in R(T,G)} \gfrak_\alpha
\end{align*}
where $R(G,T) \leq X(T)$ are the relative to $T$, and $\gfrak_\alpha$ is the subspace on which $T$ acts by $\alpha$. Each $\gfrak_\alpha$ (since $k$ is algebraically closed) is one dimensional: hence may be identified with $\Gbb_a$. Pulling back the natural action of $\Gbb_m$ on $\Gbb_a$ by scaling through $\alpha$, we obtain an action of $T$ on $\Gbb_a$. Up to scalar, there is a unique \emph{root homomorphism} $x_\alpha : \Gbb_a \to \gfrak$ intertwining the actions of $T$ on $\Gbb_a$ and on $\gfrak$, inducing an isomorphism $\dop x_\alpha : \Lie(\Gbb_a) \approx \gfrak_\alpha$. Let $U_\alpha$ denote the corresponding subgroup of $G$.
After normalizing $x_\alpha$ and $x_{-\alpha}$ suitably, there is a unique homomorphism $\phi_\alpha:\SL_2 \to g$ such that $\phi_\alpha(\tbt{1}{a}{0}{1}) = x_\alpha(a)$ and $\phi_{\alpha} (\tbt{1}{0}{a}{1}) = x_{-\alpha}(a)$
The dual coroots $\alpha^v \in \hom(\Gbb_m,T)$ are defined by the relation $\alpha^v(\lambda) = \phi_\alpha(\tbt{\lambda}{0}{0}{\lambda^\inv})$
For each $\alpha \in R$, there is an involution $s_\alpha : X(T) \to X(T)$ defined by $s_\alpha (x) = x - \ip{x, \alpha^v}\alpha$, which restricts to a permutation on $R$.
The \emph{finite weyl group} associated to the root datum $(R,X,R^v,X^v)$ is the group generated by the $s_\alpha$ for $\alpha \in R$.
The weyl group acts transitively on the choices of simple roots $\sigma \subset R$, and subordinate to any such choice on defines the \emph{positive roots}$R_+=\{\alpha \in R : \alpha \in \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma} \Zbb_{\geq 0} \sigma \}$, \emph{simple reflections} $S_f = \{s_\alpha : \alpha \in \Sigma\}$, and the \emph{dominant weights} $X_+ = \{ \lambda \in X : \ip{\lambda}{\alpha^v}\geq 0, \, \alpha \in\Sigma \}$.
(easymotion-prefix)ll
A choice of $R_+$ yeilds a \emph{Borel subgroup} $B^+$ containing $T$ such that $B^+=TU^+$ where $U^+$ is the subgroup generated by the $U_\alpha$ for $\alpha \in R$
\subsection{Parabolic subgroups: tautological representations from flag variety quotients}zo
At the level of algebraic groups (and algebraic representations,) every rep of $G$ embeds in
some number of copies of $k[G]$. As an affine coordinate ring, $k[G]$ is in many regards too large to deal with on its own. \emph{Parabolic subgroups} $P$ of $G$ are those for which the quotient variety $G/P$ is as small (in the algebro-geometric context) as possible.
When $G=SL_2$, the quotient $G/B^+$ identfies with $\Pbb^1$ viz. the set of lines in $k^2$: indeed the action of $G$ on such lines is transitive, and $B^+$ is the stabilizer of the line spanned by $e_1 = (1,0)$. More generally, when $G=GL_n$, the quotient $G/B^+$ identifies with the variety $\Fcal$ of full flags $0 \leq V_1 \leq \ldots \leq V_n = k^n$ where each $V_i$ is $i$-dimensional.
\begin{definition}
  Suppose $G$ acts on a $k$-scheme $X$ through $\sigma G \times X \to X$. A $G$-equivariant sheaf $\Fcal$ on $X$ is a sheaf of $\Ocal_X$ modules together with an isomorphism $\phi: \sigma^* \Fcal \to p_2^* \Fcal$ of $\Ocal_{G\times X}$ modules, which satisfies the cocycle condition $p^*_{23}\phi \circ (1_G \times \sigma)^*\phi = (m \times 1_X )^*\phi$.  The isomorphism $\phi$ yeilds a $G$-equivariant identification of stalks: $\Fcal_{gx} \approx \Fcal_x$ and the cocycle condition ensures that the identifications are compatible: $\Fcal_{ghx} \approx \Fcal_{hx} \approx \Fcal_x$.
\end{definition}
For any such sheaf, the $k$-vectorspace of global sections $\Gamma(X,\Fcal)$ admits a natural representation of $G$. Conversely, for any $G$ module $V$, $G$ acts on $\Pbb(V^*)$, and the tautological bundle $\Ocal(1)$ is an equivariant line bundle for this action. One recovers the action of $G$ on $V$ from the action on global sections: $\Gamma(\Pbb(V))$
\begin{thm}[Borel fixed point theorem]
  Let $H$ be a connected solvable algebraic group acting through regular functions on a nonempty complete variety $W$ over an algebraically closed field. Then there exists a point of $W$ fixed by $H$.
\end{thm}
\begin{definition}\label{def:associated-sheaf}
  Let $G$ be a $k$-group scheme acting freely on a $k$-scheme $X$ in such a way that $X/H$ is a scheme; let $\pi: X \to X/H$ be the projection map. The \textbf{associated sheaf functor} is
  \[ \Lcal=\Lcal_{X,H} : \{H -\text{modules}\} \to \{\text{vector bundles on} \, X/H\} \]
  defined on objects as follows: if $U \subset X/H$ is open, then
  \[\Lcal(M)(U) = \{ f \in \Hom_{\text{scheme}}(\pi^\inv (U), M_a) : f(xh) = h^\inv f(x)\}. \]
  Note: if $\pi^\inv(U)$ is affine, these sections coincide with $(M \otimes k[\pi^\inv U])^H$.
\end{definition}
For any $\lambda \in X(T)=\Hom(X,\Gbb_m)$, let $k_\lambda$ be the representation of $B$ pulled back through the projection $B \to B/[B,B] \approx T$, and define the sheaf $\Ocal(\lambda) = \Lcal_{G,B}(k_{-\lambda})$ on $G/B$.
Given a choice of positive roots $R_+$ and corresponding Borel $B$, let $\bar{B}$ be the opposite Borel (corresponding to the choice of $-R_+$ as positive rooots) and $\bar{U}$ its unipotent radical. A consequence of the Bruhat decomposition of $G$ is that the map $\bar{U} \to G / \bar{B}$ sending $u$ to $u\bar{B}/\bar{B}$ is an open inclusion. Furthermore, the (cartesian) product map $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in R^+}$ yeilds parametrization of $\bar{U}$ (identiftying the latter with $\Abb^{|R_+|}$.
\section{Witt Vectors}
\begin{thm}
  Let $K$ be a perfect ring of characteristic $p$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item There is a strict $p$-ring $R$ with residue ring $K$, unique up to canonical isomorphism.
    \item There is a unique system of representatives $\tau : K \to R$ (teichmulller representatives) such that $\tau(xy)=\tau(x)\tau(y)$ for $x,y\in K$.
    \item Every element $x \in  R$ can be written uniquely in the form $x = \tau(x_n) p^n$ for $x_n \in K$.
    \item Formation of $R$ and $\tau$ is functorial in $K$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
The simplest example: take $R= \Zbb_p$ and $K = \Fbb_p$, then by Hensel's lemma, each nonzero $x \in \Fbb_p$ has a unique lift $\tau(x)$ to $\Zbb_p$, and extending $\tau$ by $0$ to $\Fbb_p$ completes the definition.
A central question: given $x = \sum \tau(x_n)p^n$ and $y = \sum \tau (y_n) p^n $ write $xy = \sum \tau(m_n) p^n$ and $x+y = \sum \tau(s_n) p^n$. How can we determine $\tau(s_n)$ and $\tau(m_n)$ in terms of $x$ and $y$?
An important
\begin{lemma}
  Let $A$ be a ring, and $x,y\in A$ such that $x=y \mod pA$. Then for all $i\geq 0$ we have $x^{p^i} = y^{p^i} \mod p^{i+1}A$.
\end{lemma}
Note the two maps in play: there is the teichmuller lift $\tau : K \to R$, and an infinite sequence of maps $\pi_n=(\cdot)_n : R \to K$ such that the mapping $\cdot \mapsto \sum \tau( (\cdot)_n ) p^n$  is the identity on $R$. A preliminary goal is to understand the compositions $(x,y) \mapsto \pi_n(x+y)$ and $(x,y) \mapsto \pi_n(xy)$.
The answer is as follows:
\begin{equation*}
  s_1(x,y) = x_1 + y_1 - \sum_{n=1}^{p-1} (p/n)\binom{p}{n} x_0^{n/p}y_0^{(p-n)/p}
\end{equation*}
\begin{definition}
  A set $P$ of natural numbers is \bf{divisor-stable} if it is nonempty and for all $n \in P$, all divisors of $n$ are also in $P$. For a divisor stable set $P$ let $\mathcal{p}{P}$ be the set of prime numbers in $P$. Let $P_p = \{p^n: n\geq 0\}$ and $P_{p(n)} = \{ p^j: 0 \leq j \leq n \}$ (these are both divisor stable).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  Let $n\in \Nbb$, define the \textbf{$n$-th witt polynomial} as
  \begin{equation*}
    w_n = \sum_{d \vert n} d x_d^{n/d} \in \Zbb[ \{ X_d : d \vert n \} ].
  \end{equation*}
  For any divisor stable $P$ and any ring $A$, define
  \begin{equation*}
    W_P(A) = \prod_{n \in P} A.
  \end{equation*}
  And for $x\in W_P(A)$ write $\pi_n(x) = x_n \in A$ for the projection to the $n$-th factor. For $P = \Nbb$ write $W(A)$ for $W_P(A)$ and if $P=P_p$m, write $W_p(A)$ for $W_P(A)$.
\end{definition}
The witt polynomials $w_n$ are then (set theoretic) maps $w_n : W_P(A) \to A$. Write $w_*$ for the cartesian product of these maps.  For $x\in W_P(A)$, the values $w_n(x)$ are called the \bf{ghost components of $x$}.
\begin{thm}
  Let $P$ be a divisor stable set. There is a unique covariant functor $W_P : \rm{Alg}_\Zbb \to \rm{Alg}_\Zbb$, such
  that for any ring $A$,
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $W_P(A) = \prod_{n \in P} A = A^P$ as sets, and for a ring hom $f : A \to B$, one has
          \begin{equation*}
            W_P(f) ((a_n)_{n\in P})  = (f(a_n))_{n \in P}.
          \end{equation*}
    \item The maps $W_P(A) \to A$ are ring homomorphisms for all $n \in P$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Furthermore the zero element is  $(0,0,\ldots)$ and the unit element is $(1,0,\ldots)$.
\end{thm}
A remark: If $A$ is a $K$ algebra, then $W_P(A)$ need not be a $K$ algebra. For example, when $A = \Fbb_p$ and $P=\{
  p^\Nbb\}$, then $W_P(\Fbb_p)= \Zbb_p$ but the latter is not an algebra over $\Fbb_p$. Nonetheless, $W_P$ sends
$K$-algebras to $\Zbb$-algebras.
For a ring $A$, let $\Lambda (A) = 1 + t A[[t]]$ (a multiplicative abelian group). Then for any element $f= 1 +
  \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n t^n  \in \Lambda(A)$, there is a unique expression $f = \prod (1 - y_n t^n)$ for $y_n \in A$.
Furthermore, there exist polynomials $Y_n \in \Zbb[X_1,...,X_n]$ and $X'_n \in \Zbb[Y'_n,...,Y'_n]$ independent of
$A$ such that $y_n = Y_n ( x_1 , ..., x_n )$ and $x_n = X'_n(y_1, ... , y_n)$.
Consequently: for any ring $A$ the map $x \mapsto f_x : W(A) \to \Lambda(A)$ defined by
\begin{equation}
  f_x (t) = \prod (1-x_n t^n),
\end{equation}
where $x = (x_1, ...)$ is a bijection.
For any $\Qbb$-algebra $A$, the mercator series defines a bijection $\log : \Lambda(A) \to t A[[t]]$ with inverse given
by the exponential series $\exp : t A [[t]] \to \Lambda(A)$. In fact, $\log$ is a homomorphism of abelian groups (the
former being multiplicative and the latter additive). The map $f \mapsto -t \dop f / \dop t $ is an automorphism of
$tA[[t]]$ (additive), and its inverse is $\int - t^\inv (\cdot ) \dop t$.  Let $D = -t \frac{\dop }{\dop t} \log
  (\cdot): \Lambda(A) \to t A[[t]]$.

%	\section{Lifting curves under covers: three perspectives}
%In what follows, I will give three different descriptions of some numerical invariants associated to a finite Riemannian cover $\pi : M \to M_o$, a closed geodesic $\pfrak \subset M_o$, and a lift $\Pfrak \subset \pi^\inv ( \pfrak) \subset M$. 
%These invariants are:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item The inertial degree: $f_\pi(\Pfrak \vert \pfrak)$
%	\item The number $g_\pi(\pfrak)$ of connected components $\Pfrak \subset \pi^\inv(\pfrak)$
%	\item When $\pi: M \to M_o$ is galois with $\Gal(\pi) = G$: a conjugacy class $\ON{frob_\pfrak} \subset G$.  	
%\end{itemize} 
%
%	\subsection{The Riemannian description}
%Given a closed geodesic $\pfrak$ on $M_o$, its preimage under the cover $\pi$ is a disjoint union of $g = g_\pi(\pfrak)$ closed geodesics $\Pfrak$ on $M$. For any such $\Pfrak$ lying over $\pfrak$, the ratio of their lengths $f=f_\pi (\Pfrak \vert \pfrak) = \frac{\ell(\Pfrak)}{\ell(\pfrak)}$ is an integer.  
% 
%When the cover is finite and regular, the deck group $G$ acts by isometries on $M$, permuting transitively the components $\Pfrak$ lying over $\pfrak$. The set-wise stabilizer $G_\Pfrak$ of any component $\Pfrak$  acts by isometries on $\Pfrak \approx S^1$, and in fact $G_\Pfrak \lmod \Pfrak$ is isometric to $\pfrak$. In particular the $G_\Pfrak$ is cyclic of order $f$, and the number $g$ of components $\Pfrak$ lying over $\pfrak$ is $|G \rmod G_\Pfrak | = \deg(\pi)\rmod f $  
%
%\subsection{The topological description}
\def\pimx{\pi_1(M,x)}
%\def\pimoxo{\pi_1(M_o,x_o)}
%Let $r : S^1 \to \pfrak \subset M_o$ be a parameterization of a closed geodesic $\pfrak$ on $M_o$. Pick a point $x_o$ on $\pfrak$. Then $r$ lifts to a closed curve $\tilde{r} : S^1 \to M$ if and only if, for some $x \in \pi^\inv(x_o)$, the homotopy class of $r$ in $\pimoxo$ lies in the image of $\pimx$ under the inclusion induced by $\pi$. 
%
%For each such lift $x$ of $x_o$, there is a least integer $f=f(x_o , \pfrak)$ such that the $f$-fold concatenation $r^f$ is homotopic to an element of $\pimx$. 
%
%\subsection{The group theoretic description}
%Let $\tilde{M}$ be the common universal cover of $M$ and $M_o$, and let $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_o$ denote $\pimx$ and $\pimoxo$ respectively, so that $M = \Gamma \lmod \tilde{M}$ and $M_o = \Gamma_o \lmod \tilde{M}$. Recall that the free homotopy class of a loop corresponds to a conjugacy class in any of a space's (based)  fundamental groups. Given a closed geodesic $\pfrak$ on $M_o$, we may identify it with a conjugacy  class in $\Gamma_o$.  By definition, $\Gamma_o$ acts transitively on $\pfrak$, by conjugation. Restricting this action to the subgroup $\Gamma \leq \Gamma_o$, the $\Gamma_o$-conjugacy class $\pfrak$ will break up into a union of $g=g(\pfrak)$ disjoint $\Gamma$-orbits: $\pfrak = \bigsqcup_{i=1} ^g \Pfrak_i$, 
\section{Selberg zeta formalism}
For a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ of negative curvature and a unitary representation $\rho : \pimx = \Gamma \to \GL(V)$, one can form the \textbf{Selberg zeta function}: for $s$ a complex variable in a suitable right-halfplane
	\begin{align*}
		Z_\Gamma(s, \rho) = \prod_{\gamma \in \Gamma_{pcc}} \prod_{k \geq 0} \det \left( \id_V - \rho(\gamma) e^{-(s+k) \ell(\gamma)} \right),
	\end{align*}
where the product is over the set $\Gamma_{pcc}$ of primitive conjugacy classes $\gamma$ in $\Gamma$, and $\ell(\gamma)$ is the Riemannian length of the corresponding geodesic. 
	\begin{claim} \label{claim1}
		The following assertions are purely formal: 
		\begin{itemize}
				\item Knowledge of $Z_\Gamma(s,\rho)$  amounts to the knowledge of the following data set: for each length $\ell \in \Rbb_{\geq 0}$, the value of the sum 
					\[ \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma_{pcc}, \ell(\gamma^k) = \ell } \Tr(\rho(\gamma))/ k. \]
				In particular, if $\rho = 1$ is trivial then knowledge of $Z_\Gamma(s,1)$ amounts to knowing the length spectrum of $\Gamma$. 
				\item \textbf{Functoriality under direct sums:} $Z_\Gamma{s, \rho}$ is multiplicative w/r/t direct sum of representations: 
					\[ Z_\Gamma(s,\rho \oplus \sigma) = Z_\Gamma(s,\rho) Z_\Gamma(s,\sigma).  \] 
				\item $Z_\Gamma(s, \rho)$ depends only on the isomorphism class of $\rho$, so is consequently dependent only on its  character $\Tr\circ \rho$. 
				\item \textbf{A consequence of the preceeding two observations}: While $Z_\Gamma(s,\rho)$ is initially only defined for representations $\rho$, we can extend its definition to any conjugacy invariant function on $\Gamma$ which arises as a finite linear sum of characters of representations.   
				\item \textbf{Functoriality under finite covers:} Suppose $N \to M$ is a finite cover and $ \pi_1(N,y) =  \Lambda \leq \Gamma = \pimx $. For any representation $\sigma: \Lambda \to \GL(V)$ on the cover, one can realize $Z_\Lambda(s, \sigma)$ as a Selberg zeta function for the base $M$ via induction:
					\[ Z_\Lambda(s,\sigma) = Z_\Gamma (s , \ind_{\Lambda}^{\Gamma} \sigma ). \]
		\end{itemize}
	\end{claim}
	In order to directly relate $Z_\Gamma(s,\rho)$ to the Laplace spectrum of $M$, it suffices to take $M$ to be locally symmetric (and negatively curved). In this setting if we let $\tilde{M}$ denote the universal cover, and let $\Gamma$ act on $\tilde{M}$ by isometries so that $M \approx \Gamma \rmod \tilde{M}$, then we can define the space 
		\[ L^2 (M, \rho) = \{ f \in L^2(M,V): f(gz)= \rho(g)f(z)\} \] 
	and consider the spectral problem for $\Delta_\rho = \Delta \otimes \id_V$ acting on it. The following is \emph{almost} purely formal (modulo understanding the Selberg trace formula)
		\begin{claim}
				Up to a (topological) fudge factor:
					\[ Z_\Gamma(s,\rho) = \det \left(\Delta_\rho - s(s-1)\right). \]
				In particular, away from the zeroes of the fudge factor (the so-called trivial zeroes), the zeroes of $Z_\Gamma(s,\rho)$ occur precisely at the eigenvalues of $\Delta_\rho$ acting on $L^2(M,\rho)$, taken with multiplicty.  
		\end{claim}
\subsection{A converse to Sunada: formulation}
Suppose one has a diamond of Riemannian covers: 
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		& M \\
		{N_1} && {N_2} \\
		& {M_o}
		\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-1]
		\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-3]
		\arrow[from=2-1, to=3-2]
		\arrow[from=2-3, to=3-2]
		\end{tikzcd}\]
with corresponding (flipped) configuration of fundamental groups: 
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
	& {\Gamma_o=\pi_1(M_o)} \\
	{\Lambda_1=\pi_1(N_1)} && {\Lambda_2=\pi_1(N_2)} \\
	& {\Gamma=\pi_1(M)}
	\arrow[hook, from=2-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[hook, from=3-2, to=2-1]
	\arrow[hook', from=3-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow[hook', from=2-3, to=1-2]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	\begin{question}
			Suppose $N_1$ and $N_2$ are isospectral. Are $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ almost-conjugate in $\Gamma_o$? That is: if $N_1$ and $N_2$ are isospectral and live in a diamond, is that diamond a sunada diamond? 
	\end{question}
	Applying the Selberg zeta formalism to this question, it is 	equivalent to ask:
	\begin{question}
		Suppose $Z_{\Gamma_o}(s, \ind_{\Lambda_1}^{\Gamma_o}1)  = Z_{\Gamma_o}(s, \ind_{\Lambda_2}^{\Gamma_o}1)$.  Can one conclude that, as $\Gamma_o$ representations, $\ind_{\Lambda_1}^{\Gamma_o}1=\ind_{\Lambda_2}^{\Gamma_o}1$ ?
	\end{question}
	Applying the first bullet in claim \ref{claim1}, this amounts to asking: 
	\begin{question}
		Suppose that, for all $\ell$ in $\Rbb_{\geq 0}$, one has 
			\[ \sum_{\gamma \in {\Gamma_o}_{pcc}, \ell(\gamma^k) = \ell }\chi_{\Lambda_1}^{\Gamma_o}(\gamma)/k   = \sum_{\gamma \in {\Gamma_o}_{pcc}, \ell(\gamma^k) = \ell } \chi_{\Lambda_1}^{\Gamma_o}(\gamma)/k, \] 
			(where $\chi_{\Lambda_i}^{\Gamma_o}$ is the trace of the induced representation) must then  $\chi_{\Lambda_1}^{\Gamma_o} =\chi_{\Lambda_1}^{\Gamma_o}?$
	\end{question}

\title{On a converse to Sunada}
\author{Justin Katz}
\begin{document}
\maketitle 
 
Sunada introduced a group theoretic mechanism for producing pairs of isospectral manifolds. In this note, I formulate a converse to that construction and discuss some avenues by which one might prove them.
\paragraph{Gassman triples}
Let $G$ be a finite group and $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ subgroups. We say that the triple $(G,H_{1},H_{2})$ is Gassman, or that $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ are almost conjugate in $G$, if any of the following three equivalent conditions are met:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For any  $G$-conjugacy class $C \subset G$,  the cardinality of the set $C\cap H_{i}$ is independent of $i$.\
	\item The $\Q[G]$ isomorphism type of $\Q[G/H_{i}]$ is independent of $i$
	\item The $k[G]$ isomorphism type of $k[G/H_{i}]$ is independent of $i$ for any field $k$ of characteristic zero.
	\item For any irreducible representation $(\rho,V)$ of $G$, the dimension of $V^{H_{i}}$ is independent of $i$. 
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Sunada diamonds}
Let $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ be closed Riemannian manifolds, and suppose that the universal covers $\tilde{M_{i}}$, equipped with the pullback metric, are isometric; in this case write $\tilde{M}$ for $\tilde{M_{i}}$.   Write $\Gamma_{i} = \pi_{1}(M_{i})$, which we view as subgroups of $\Isom(\tilde{M})$ acting by deck transformations of the universal covering map, so that $M_{i} \approx \Gamma_{i} \lmod \tilde{M}$. We say that $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are \textbf{commensurable} if they admit a common finite Riemannian cover, and \textbf{strongly commensurable} if furthermore there is a Riemannian manifold admitting both $M_1$ and $M_2$ as finite Riemannian covers.  Then $M_1$ and $M_2$ are commensurable if, after a suitable conjugation, the intersection $\Gamma_1\cap \Gamma_2$ has finite index in both $\Gamma_i$, and are strongly commensurable if each $\Gamma_i$ has finite index in the group generated by the product $\Gamma_1\Gamma_2$ in $\Isom(\tilde{M})$. 
Suppose now that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are strongly commensurable, with common cover $M_{o}$, commonly covering $M$, and that the cover $M_{o} \to M$ is regular, with deck group $G$. If $\Gamma = \pi_{1}(M)$ and $\Gamma_{o} = \pi_{1}(M_{o})$ then this assumption amounts to $\Gamma_{o} \triangleleft \Gamma$ and $\Gamma/\Gamma_{o} = G$.

\title{Some tautological bundles over the Bruhat--Tits tree}
\author{Justin Katz}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
The nodes $V(\Tcal)$ of the Bruhat--Tits tree $\Tcal$ represent similarity (or homothety) classes of $\ofrak$ lattices in a two dimensional $\kfrak$ vectorspace. These lattices, in turn, are specified by a choice of basis.

%\maketitle 
%In this note $\kfrak$ is a $\pfrak$-adic field, with ring of integers $\ofrak$, maximal ideal $\pfrak$, and $k = \ofrak /\pfrak$ its residue field.  We let $V$ denote a $2$-dimensional $\kfrak$-vectorspace, and $\Xcal$ the Bruhat-Tits tree of $\kfrak$-homothety classes of $\ofrak$-lattices in $V$. 
%
%Two homothety classes $\Lambda, \Lambda' \in \Xcal$ are adjacent, written as $\Lambda \sim \Lambda'$,  if they have representative lattices $L \in \Lambda$ and $L' \in \Lambda'$ such that
%	\begin{align*}
%	\pfrak L  \leq L ' \leq L.	
%	\end{align*}
%	For a class $\Lambda \in \Xcal$, let $N(\Lambda) = \{ \Lambda ' : \Lambda' \sim \Lambda \}$ denote its $1$-neighborhood. There is 
%
%\begin{lemma}
%		Let $g\in \SL(2,\kfrak)$ satisfy 
%		\begin{enumerate}
%			\item $\tr(g) \in \ofrak$ 
%			\item $x^2 - \tr(g) x +1 $ is reducible modulo $\pfrak^j$.
%		\end{enumerate}
%		Then $g$ pointwise fixes a geodesic of length $j$ in $X$. 
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%	Since $\tr(g) \in \ofrak$, it fixes some vertex $\Lambda_0 \in X$. Let $N_j(\Lambda)$ denote the $j$-neighborhood of $\Lambda$. We identify $N_j(\Lambda)$ with the projective line $\Pbb^1(\ofrak \rmod \pfrak^j)$.

When $F$ is a field and $a,b \in F^\times$ let $\hilbert{a}{b}{F}$ denote the quaternion algebra
\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{a, b}{F}\right) = F + \mathbf{i}F + \mathbf{j}F + \mathbf{ij}F,
\end{align*}
over $F$, subject to the relations $\mathbf{i}^2 = a $, $\mathbf{j}^2 = b$ and $\mathbf{ij}+\mathbf{ji} =0$. This algebra is equipped with the anti-involution
\begin{align*}
    x = x_1+\mathbf{i} x_2+\mathbf{j} x_3+\mathbf{i j} x_4 \mapsto \bar{x} := x_1-\mathbf{i} x_2-\mathbf{j} x_3-\mathbf{i} \mathbf{j} x_4,
\end{align*}
with respect to which, one defines the (reduced) \textbf{trace} and \textbf{norm}:
\begin{align*}
    \trd x & = x+\bar{x} \\
    \nrd x & = x\bar{x}.
\end{align*},
so that $x$ satisfies its \textbf{reduced characteristic polynomial}
\begin{align*}
    \chi_x(T) := T^2 -\trd x T + \nrd x.
\end{align*}
If $A$ is a quaternion algebra over $F$, and $E/F$ is an extension, set $A_E := A \otimes_F E$. We say that $A$ \textbf{splits over} $E$ if $A_E \approx M(2,E)$ as $E$-algebras. If $A$ does not split over $E$, then $A_E$ is a division quaternion algebra over $E$.
Now let $k$ be a number field, and $A$ be a quaternion algebra over $k$. For each place $\nu \in \Sigma_k$, set $A_\nu := A_{k_\nu}$. If $k_\nu \neq \Cbb$, then there is a unique quaternion division algebra over $k_\nu$, which we write as $D_\nu$. We say that $A$ is \textbf{ramified} at $\nu$ if $A_\nu \approx D_\nu$, and write $\Ram A : = \{ \nu \in \Sigma_k : A_\nu \approx D_\nu\}$ for the set of places over which $A$ is ramified. Write $\Ram_f A = \Ram A \cap \Sigma_f$ and $\Ram_\infty A = \Ram A \cap \Sigma_\infty$.
Define an algebraic group $PA^\times=A^\times/k^\times$ over $k$ by the rule
\begin{align*}
    PA^\times(L) = (A\otimes_k L)^\times/ L^\times
\end{align*}
for any $k$-algebra $L$. Note, in particular, that
% \begin{align*}
%     PA^\times(k_\nu) \approx
%     \begin{cases}
%         \PGL(2,k_\nu)           & if $\nu \notin \Ram A$ \\
%         D^\times / k_\nu^\times & if $\nu \in \Ram A$.
%     \end{cases}
% \end{align*}
We say an element $x\in A$ is semisimple (resp. regular semisimple) if it is diagonalizable in $A_{\bar{k}}\approx M(2,\bar{k})$ (resp. diagonalizable with distinct eigenvalues). The centralizer of a regular semisimple element $x\in A$ is $k[x]\subset A$, which is a seperable quadratic algebra over $k$. Consequently, $k[x]$ is either isomorphic to  $k\times k$, in which case we say  $x$ is $k$-\textbf{split},  or is isomorphic to quadratic field exension of $k$, in which case we say $x$ is $k$-\textbf{elliptic}. In either case, one has $\trd(x) = \tr_{k(x)/k}(x)$ and $\nrd(x) = N_{k(x)/k}(x)$. We say an element $\gamma \in PA^\times$ is semimple (resp. regular semisimple, split, or elliptic) if any of its lifts to $A^\times$ are.
Fix $\Kbb = \Rbb$ or $\Cbb$. For a number field $k$, with archimedean places $\nu_1,\dots,\nu_s$, and a quaternion algebra $A$ over $k$, we say that the pair $(k,A)$ is \textbf{admissible} if $k_{\nu_1} \approx \Kbb$ and $A_{\nu_1} \approx M(2,\Kbb)$, while $k_{\nu_i} \approx \Rbb$ and $A_{\nu_i}\approx D_\Rbb$, for $i=2,\dots s$.
With an admissible pair $(k,A)$ fixed, define the affine $k$-group scheme $\Gbf = PA^\times$. For each place $\nu \in \Sigma_k$, let $p_\nu : \Abb \to k_\nu$ denote the $\nu$-th coordinate projection of the adele ring $\Abb:=\Abb_k$ of $k$. We use the same letter to denote the induced projection $p_\nu: \Gbf(\Abb) \to \Gbf(k_\nu)$. Note that for all $\nu \in \Sigma_k$, the restriction $p_\nu$ to the diagonally embedded copy of $\Gbf(k)$ in $\Gbf(\Abb)$ is injective.
For a compact open subgroup $V$ of $\Gbf(\Abb_f)$, the group
\begin{align*}
    \Gamma_V := \Gbf(k) \cap (\Gbf(\Abb_\infty)\times V),
\end{align*}
embeds via $p_{\nu_1}$ as a lattice in $\Gbf(k_{\nu_1}) \approx \PGL(2,\Kbb)$. When convenient, we will identify $\Gamma_V$ with its image $p_{\nu_1}(\Gamma_V)$ in $\PGL(2,\Kbb)$.
\begin{proposition} %lemma 1 in zotero://select/library/items/FULIVRTB
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Gamma_V$ is a congruence arithmetic lattice in $\PGL(2,\Kbb)$, and any congruence arithmetic lattice in $\PGL(2,\Kbb)$ is conjugate to one of the form $\Gamma_V$.
        \item Every arithmetic lattice $\Gamma \leq \PGL(2,\Kbb)$ is contained in $\Gamma_U$ for some choice of admissible pair $(k,A)$ with $U$ a \emph{maximal compact open}  subgroup of $\Gbf(\Abb_f)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\paragraph*{Maximal compact opens}
A maximal compact open subgroup $U$ of $\Gbf(\Abb_f)$ decomposes as a product $U = \prod_{\pfrak \in \Sigma_f} U_\pfrak$ where $U_\pfrak$ is a maximal compact open subgroup of $\Gbf(k_\pfrak)$. For $\pfrak \in \Ram_f A$ there is a unique maximal compact subgroup of $\Gbf(k_\pfrak)$, namely $\Gbf(k_\pfrak)$ itself. For $\pfrak \notin \Ram_f A$, there are two conjugacy classes of maximal compact open subgroups in $\Gbb(k_\pfrak)$. If an isomorphism $\Gbb(k_\pfrak) \approx \PGL(2,k_\pfrak)$ is chosen, then representatives for these two classes are:
\begin{align*}
    U_\pfrak^0 & := \PGL(2,\ofrak_\pfrak)                                                                                                  \\
    U_\pfrak^1 & := \left\langle\left(\begin{array}{ll}
                                              0   & 1 \\
                                              \pi & 0
                                          \end{array}\right),\left(\begin{array}{cc}
                                                                       \mathfrak{o}_{\mathfrak{p}}^{\times} & \mathfrak{o}_{\mathfrak{p}}          \\
                                                                       \mathfrak{p}                         & \mathfrak{o}_{\mathfrak{p}}^{\times}
                                                                   \end{array}\right)\right\rangle / k_{\mathfrak{p}}^{\times}
\end{align*}
\paragraph*{Trace Formula}
Let $U$ be a maximal compact open subgroup of $\Gbf(\Abb_f)$
Write $G = \PGL(2,\Kbb)$, so that $\Gbb(\Abb) = G \times \SO(3)^{s-1}\times \Gbb(\Abb_f)$.
\section*{remarks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $A$ is a quat alg over a field $k$ char $0$ then  $A^1= [A^*,A^*]$.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Local analysis}
% In this section, $F$ is non-archimedean local field, and $O$ is its ring of integers, $G = \GL_2$ (over $F$),$\Hcal$ is the algebra of compactly supported functions on $G(F)$ which are bi-$G(O)$ invariant, $A$ is the group of diagonal matrices, $X^*$ is its lattice of rational characters,  $X^*= \hom(X^*,\Zbb)$.
% The lattice $X^*$ of characters of $A$ is freely generated by $\chi_1:\tbt{a}{}{}{b} \mapsto a$ and $\chi_2:\tbt{a}{}{}{b} \mapsto b$.
% For $\gamma = \tbt{a}{}{}{b}$, set $\Delta(\gamma) = |\frac{(a-b)^2}{ab}|^{1/2}$. This is nonzero if and only if $\gamma$ is regular. For such $\gamma$, set
% \begin{align*}
%     F_f(\gamma) = \Delta(\gamma) = \int_{A(F)\lmod G(F)} f(g^\inv \gamma g) \dop g$.
% \end{align*}
\1
For langlands, $\lambda(\gamma)= (k,k')$ means that $M_0/\gamma M_0 \approx O/\pfrak^k \oplus O/\pfrak^{k'}$ as $O$ modules, where $M_0$ is the standard lattice $O\oplus O$ in $F \oplus F$.
Let $\Xcal$ be BT tree for $\SL(2,F)$. Write $M_0$ for the standard lattice $O\oplus O \subset F \oplus F$, and $p_0$ the corresponding vertex. Associated to the diagonal torus $A$ is the apartment $\Afrak= A(F)p_0$. This subtree is a line: every vertex lies on exactly two edges.
For any two points $p_1,p_2$ in $X$, there is a $g\in G(F)$  and a $t\in A(F)$ such that $p_1 = g t p_0$ and $p_2 = gp_0$.
Let $\Xcal'$ be the simplicial complex defined as follows: the points are lattices in $F^2$, and two lattices $M_1$ and $M_2$ are joined by an edge if $M_1>M_2 > \pi M_1$ or $M_2>M_1 > \pi M_2$.
\section*{my thots}
Let $G=\PGL(2,F)$ and consider the set $X$ of maximal compact open subgroups of $G$.
\section*{notes on trees}
If $A,B$ are two groups, and $R$ is the kernel of the canonical map $A*B \to A\times B$, then $R$ is a free group with free generating set consisting of elements $[a,b]=aba^\inv b^\inv $ for all $a\in A\setminus 1$ and $b\in B\setminus 1$.
For serre, a graph $\Gamma$ is a pair of sets $X=V(\Gamma)$ and $Y=E(\Gamma)$ equipped with a map $Y\mapsto X\times X$, written $y \mapsto (o(y),t(y))$ and a map $Y\to Y$, written $y\mapsto \bar{y}$ satisfying the conditons:
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item $\bar{\cdot}$ is an involution on $Y$, acting without fixed point
    \item for all $y\in Y$, one has $o(y) = t(\bar{y})$ (equiv. $(o,t)\circ \bar{\cdot}$ is $(t,o)$).
\end{enumerate*}
For an edge $y$, $t(y)$ and $o(y)$ are the terminus and origin of $y$ resp, and together they form the extremities of $y$. Two vertices are adjacent if there is an edge for which they form the extremities.
An orientation on $\Gamma$ is a subset $Y_+$ of edges $Y$, such that $Y=Y_+\sqcup \overline{Y_+}$, the union being disjoint.
To give an oriented graph is to give the set $X$ of vertices and the set $Y_+$ of positively oriented edges, along with a map $Y_+ \to X\times X$.
For a graph $\Gamma = (X,Y,o,t,\bar{\cdot})$, consider the topological space defined as follows: give $X,Y$ the discrete topology, and let $T= X\sqcup (Y\times [0,1])$ and form the quotient by the relation $(y,t)\sim (\bar{y}, 1-t)$, $(y,0)\sim o(y)$, $(y,1)\sim t(y)$ for $y\in Y$ and $t\in [0,1]$. Then $real(\Gamma)= T/\sim$ is called the realization of $\Gamma$.
\newcommand{\path}{\operatorname{path}}
Let $path_n$ be the oriented graph with vertices $0,\dots,n$ and orientation given by the edges $[i,i+1]$ for $0\leq i <n$, where $o[i,i+1]=i$ and $t[i,i+1]=i+1$.
A path of length $n$ in a graph is a morphism $c:\path_n\to \Gamma$. For a given length $n$ path $c$, the sequence of edges  $y_i=c[i-1,i]$ such that $t(y_i)=o(y_{i+1})$ for $1\leq i <n$ determines $c$ (and conversely). We identify $c$ with this sequence of edges. If $P_i=c(i)$, then we say $c$ is a path from $P_0$ to $P_n$, and that $P_0$, and $P_n$ are the extremities of $c$.
A pair of the form  $(y_i,y_{i+1})=(y_i,\bar{y_i})$ in $c$ is called a backtracking. If $c$ backtracks, then we can construct a path of length $n-2$ from $P_0$ to $P_n$ by omiting the pair from the sequence. If there is a path from $p$ to $q$, then there is one without backtracking.
The direct limit of the paths is $\path_\infty$.
A simplicial complex of dimension $\leq 1$ is pair $(X,S)$ where $X$ is a set, and $S$ is a set of subsets of $X$ satisfying $|A|\leq 2$ for all $A\in S$, and such that $\{x\} \in S$ for all $x\in X$. For such a complex $(X,S)$, form the graph with vertex set $X$ and edge set consisting of pairs $(P,Q)$ of distinct elments of $X$ such that $\{ P,Q \} \in S$. In this graph, two edges with the same origin and terminus are equal. We say a graph satisfying this prop is combinatorial.
In a combinatorial graph, a set $\{P,Q\}$ of adjacent vertices is called a geometric edge. Each geometric edge determines an $\overline{\cdot}$ orbit of an edge, and conversely. Evidently, a combinatorial graph is determined by its geometric edges and its vertices.
A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. A geodesic in a tree is a path without backtracking. If $P,Q$ are vertices in a tree, then there is exactly one geodesic from $P$ to $Q$, and this path is injective.
Fix a vertex $P$ in a tree $\Gamma$. For $n\geq 0$, let $X_n(P)$ be the set of vertices $Q$ s.t. $l(P,Q)=n$. If $Q \in X_n$ and $n\geq 1$, then there is exactly one vertex $Q'$ with $l(P,Q') <n$ which is adjacent to $Q$. Thus, there is a map $f_{n,P}:X_n(P)\to X_{n-1}(P)$ for each $n\geq 1$. For each $P$, the maps $f_{n,P}$ form an inverse system. This inverse system determines the tree: the vertices is the (disjoint) union of the $X_n(P)$, and the geometric edges are $\{Q,f_{n,P}(Q)\}$ if $Q \in X_n(P)$.
This gives an equivalence between pointed trees and inverse systems of sets indexed by integers $\geq 1$.
For a vertex $p$ in a graph $\Gamma=(X,Y,o,t,\bar{\cdot})$, let $Y_p$ be the set of edges with terminus at $p$. Then $|Y_p|$ is called the index of $p$ (or degree). If $n=0$, then $p$ is isolated. If $n\leq 1$, we say $p$ is a terminal vertex.
If $\Gamma$ is a tree with diameter $n<\infty$, then $t(\Gamma)$ is nonempty. If $n\geq 2$, then $V(\Gamma)\setminus t(\Gamma)$ is the vertex set of a subtree of diameter $n-2$. If $\Gamma'$ is the subtree with vertex set $V(\Gamma)\setminus t(\Gamma)$, then $\Gamma'$ is preserved by every automorphism of $\Gamma$. By induction:
\begin{lemma}
    A tree of finite, even diameter (resp. odd diameter) has a vertex (resp. geometric edge) which is fixed by every automorphism.
\end{lemma}
If $\Gamma$ is a tree w/ finite diameter $n$, then all geodesics of $\Gamma$ with length $n$ have the same middle vertex if $n$ is odd, or the same middle geodesic edge if $n$ is even (is this backwards?)
If $\Gamma$ is a connected graph with finitely many vertices. Set $s= |V(\Gamma)|$ and $a=|E(\Gamma)|/2$. Then $a\geq s-1$ with equality if and only if $\Gamma$ is a tree.
A graph of groups $(G,T)$ consists of a graph $T$, and a family of groups $G_p$ for vertices $p$, and  $G_y$ for edges $y$, along with injections $G_y \to G_{t(y)}$ (written as $a \mapsto a^y)$ such that $G_y = G_{\bar{y}}$ for all edges $y$.
If $s \in \Aut(X)$ fixes a point then for any vertex $P$, one has $d(P,sP) \in 2\Zbb$ and if $P'$ satisfies $d(P,P')=d(P',sP)$ (i.e. if $P'$ is midpoint of $P-sP$) then $sP'=P'$.
If $s$ acts without fixed pts (say $s$ is hyperbolic ), then \begin{enumerate*}
    \item  $m = \inf_{p \in V(X)} d(p,sp) \geq 1$
    \item  $T = \{p \in V(X): d(p,sp)=m\}$ is a doubly infinite path
    \item $s$ acts on $T$ as translation w/ magnitude $m$
    \item any subtree of $X$ which is table under $s$ and $s^\inv$ contains $T$
    \item if $d(q,T)=d$, then $d(q,sq)=m+2d$.
\end{enumerate*}
If $m$ is translation length of hyperbolic elt $s$,  and $\Gamma = \langle s \rangle$ then its axis $T$ projects to a cycle of length $m$ in $\Gamma \lmod X$, and this is the unique cycle in $\Gamma \lmod X$.
\begin{proposition}
    Let  $G$ be a group generated by elements $\{a_i,b_j: i \in I,j\in J\}$, set $A=\langle a_i : i \in I\rangle $, $B=\langle b_j:j\in J \rangle$. Suppose $G$ acts on a tree $X$ such that $X^A\neq \emptyset$, $X^B\neq \emptyset$, and that for all $i \in I,j\in J$  the automorphism $a_ib_j$ has a fixed point. Then $G$ has a fixed point.
\end{proposition}
If $G$ is finitely generated, and each of its elements has a fixed point, then in fact $G$ has a fixed point. This should probably be true if $G$ is topologically finitely generated.
If $V$ is a $K$-vectorspace, write $\GL(V)$ for $\Aut_K(V)$. Its center is $K^\times$ which acts by scalars on $V$. The subgroup $\SL(V)$ can be charactarized in several ways: it is
\begin{itemize}
    \item its the subgroup of $\GL(V)$ generated by unipotent elements
    \item it is the commutator subgroup of $\GL(V)$
    \item it is the kernel of the determinant map $\det:\GL(V) \to K^\times$.
\end{itemize}
The composition $\nu \circ \det $ is a homomorphism $\GL(V) \to \Zbb$. Write $\GL(V)^0$ for its kernel, and let $\GL(V)^+$ denote the kernel of the composition $(\mod 2) \circ \nu \circ \det$. Then we have
\begin{align*}
    \SL(V) \leq \GL(V)^0\leq \GL(V)^{+} \leq \GL(V).
\end{align*}
For any two lattices $L,L'$ in $V$, set $\chi(L,L')= \ell(L/L'')- \ell (L'/L'')$ where $L''$ is any lattice contained in $L\cap L'$, and $\ell$ denotes the length of a module (the maximum length of a chain of submodules).

Let $k$ be a nonarchimedean local field of characteristic $0$, and residue characteristic $p$. Write $\nu: k^\times \to \Zbb$ for its additive valuation, and write
\begin{align*}
    R      & = \{ x \in k: \nu(x) \geq 0\} \\
    \pfrak & = \{ x \in k: \nu(x) > 0\}    \\
    \ffrak & = R/\pfrak,
\end{align*}
for the ring of integers in $k$, its unique maximal ideal, and its residue field. Write $q$ for the cardinality of the residue field $\ffrak$, so that $q=p^f$ where $f$ is the degree of $\ffrak$ over its prime field. Take as a normalized absolute value $|x| = q^{-{\nu(x)}}$. Pick a uniformizer $\pi$ for $\pfrak$.
\section*{groups}
If $\Hbf$ is an algebraic group defined over $k$, we write $H=\Hbf(k)$ for its group of $k$-valued points. Write $\Zbf_\Hbf$ and $\Hbf'$ for the center and derived subgroups of $\Hbf$, each of which being closed, normal, algebraic subgroups of $\Hbf$, defined over $k$. Set $\Pbf \Hbf = \Zbf_\Hbf \ \Hbf$, and let $P: H \to PH$ be the projection at the level of $k$-valued points.
Let $\Gbf = \GL_2$, so that $\Gbf'=\SL_2$, and $\Zbf_\Gbf \approx \Gbb_m$ embedded as scalar matrices. Then $G=\GL(2,k)$, $G'=\SL(2,k)$, and $Z = k^\times \cdot \id$, and $PG = \PGL(2,k)= Z\lmod G$.
Let $\Abf \leq \Gbf$ denote the maximal (split) torus of diagonal matrices in $\Gbf$,and let $\lambda_1,\lambda_2 : k^\times \to A$ be the cocharacters
\begin{align*}
    \lambda_1(x)=\tbt{x}{}{}{1},\quad \lambda_2(x) = \tbt{1}{}{}{x},
\end{align*}
and $\chi_1,\chi_2 : A \to k^\times$ the (dual) characters
\begin{align*}
    \chi_1(\tbt{a}{}{}{d})=a,\quad \chi_2(\tbt{a}{}{}{d})=d.
\end{align*}
Then the cocharacters $z(x) = \lambda_1(x)\lambda_2(x)$ and $a(x) = \lambda_1(x)\lambda_2(x^\inv)$ are such that \begin{enumerate*}
    \item  $z: k^\times \to Z$, and $a:k^\times \to (A\cap G') =: T $ are isomorphisms, and
    \item the character $\alpha : T \to k^\times$ dual to $a$ is a simple root for $T$ in $G'$.
\end{enumerate*}
Let $\Bbf$ the upper triangular Borel containing $\Abf$, and $\Ubf$ its unipotent radical. Define the 1-psg $u:k \to U$ by
\begin{align*}
    u(x) = \tbt{1}{x}{0}{1}.
\end{align*}
If $t \in A$, then for all $x \in k$, one has $t u(x) t^\inv = u(\alpha(t) x)$.
For $g\in G$, let $p_g(x) = \det(g - x \cdot \id ) = x^2 - \tr(g) x + \det(g)$ be its characteristic polynomial, which has discriminant $\disc(g)= \tr(g)^2 - 4 \det(g)$.
\subsubsection*{integral points}
Set $K= G \cap \GL(2,R)$, $K' = K \cap G' = \SL(2,R)$, and $PK=P(K)$ which is isomorphic to $\PGL(2,R)= R^\times \lmod \GL(2,R)$, which are maximal compact open subgroups of $G,G'$ and $PG$ respectively.
For $n>0$, let $\rho_n :  K \to \GL(2,R/\pfrak^n)$ be the homomorphism induced by the reduction map $R \to R /\pfrak^n$, and set $K(n)= \ker \rho_n$. Define $K_0(n)$, (resp. $K_1(n)$) as the preimage of $\Bbf(R/\pfrak^n)$ (resp. $\Ubf(R/\pfrak^n)$) in $K$ under $\rho_n$.  Thus an element $\tbt{a}{b}{c}{d}$ of $\GL(2,R)$ lies in $K(n)$ if and only if $a,d \in 1 + \pfrak^n$ and $b,c \in  \pfrak^n$, in $K_0(n)$ if and only if $c \in \pfrak ^n$, and in $K_1(n)$ if and only if $a,d \in 1+ \pfrak^n$ and $c \in \pfrak^n$.
If $\Hbf$ is an algebraic subgroup of $\Gbf=\GL_2$, (resp. $\Gbf'$, resp. $\Pbf \Gbf$,) we set $\Hbf(R) = \Hbf(k) \cap K$ (fresp. $\cap K'$, resp. $\cap PK$.)
\subsubsection*{$\SL_2$-centric computations}
Recall:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T$ is the maximal split torus in $\SL_2(k)$ consisting of diagonal matrices,
    \item $\alpha : T \to k^\times$ is the root $\alpha(\tbt{t}{}{}{t^\inv}) = t^2$,
    \item $B$, the borel of upper triangular elements, is associated to the choice of positive root $\alpha$ for $T$ in $G$: $B = TU$ where $U$ is the group of upper triangular unipotent elements, $u_\alpha = u : k \to U$ is a 1psg such that $g u(x) g^\inv = u(\alpha(g) x)$ for all $g\in T$ and $x \in k$.
    \item $N = N_{\SL_2(k)}(T)$ is the group of monomial matrices, the Weyl group $W=N/T$ (for $T$ in $\SL_2(k)$) has order $2$, and $w_0 = \tbt{}{-1}{1}{}$  satisfies $N = T \sqcup Tw$.
    \item The affine weyl group $\tilde{W} = N/T(R)$, is an infinite dihedral group, generated by the images $s_0$ of $w_0$  and  $s_1$ of $w_1 = \tbt{}{\pi^\inv}{-\pi}{}$ in $\tilde{W}$. One has a presentation: $\tilde{W}= \langle s_0,s_1:  s_0^2 = s_1^2 = 1\rangle$.
    \item The element $w_0 w_1 = \tbt{\pi}{}{}{\pi^\inv}$ of $N$ has infinite order modulo $T(R)$, and generates a normal subgroup of index $2$ in $\tilde{W}$.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Lattices in $k^2$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We consider $k^2$ as a space of column vectors, so that $\GL(2,k)$ acts on $k^2$ from the left. We write $e_0,e_1$ for the standard basis vectors.
    \item Recall that an $R$-lattice in a $k$-vectorspace $V$ is a finitely generated $R$-submodule of $V$ which contains a $k$-basis of $V$.
    \item Since $k$ is a local field, $R$ is a PID, so all $R$-lattices in $k^2$ constitute a single $\GL(2,k)$ orbit: any two are isomorphic as abstract $R$-modules, and any choice of $R$-module isomorphism extends uniquely to an automorphism of $k^2$
    \item For vectors $v,w \in k^2$, write $[v,w]:= Rv+Rw$ for the $R$-submodule they span. This is a lattice in $k^2$ if and only if $v,w$ are $k$-linearly independent.
    \item We write $L_0 = [e_1e_2]$ and refer to this as our standard lattice. If $g \in \GL(2,k)$, then $gL_0 = [ge_1,ge_2]$ is the lattice spanned by the columns of $g$. This defines a left-action of $\GL(2,k)$ on the set of $R$-lattices in $k^2$.
    \item If $S$ is the stabilizer of a lattice $L$ in $\GL(2,k)$, then the stabilizer of $gL$ is $gSg^\inv$. The stabilizer of the standard lattice $L_0$ in $\GL(2,k)$ is the standard maximal compact open $\GL(2,R)$.
    \item Define a relation on on the set of lattices in $k^2$ by $L\sim L'$ if there exists a scalar matrix $z \in \GL(2,k)$ such that $zL=L'$. Since $k^\times = R^\times \cdot \pi^\Zbb$ and $R^\times L= L$ for any lattice $L$, observe that $L\sim L'$ iff $L = \pi^n L'$ for some $n\in \Zbb$. If $L\sim L'$ then $\Stab_{\GL(2,k)} L =\Stab_{\GL(2,k)} L'$.
    \item The action of $\SL(2,k)$ on the set of equivalence classees of lattices in $k^2$ has exactly two orbits: representatives for these orbits are the classes of $L_0 = [e_1,e_2]$ and $L_1 = [e_1,\pi e_2]$. The stabilizer $K_0$ in $\SL(2,k)$ of $L_0$ is $\SL(2,R)$ and $K_1$ of $L_1$ is $\tbt{1}{}{}{pi}K \tbt{1}{}{}{\pi}^\inv$. That is, $g \in \SL(2,k)$ satisfies $gL_0 = L_0$ if and only if all of its entries are in $R$, while $gL_1 = L_1$ if and only if $ge_1 = a e_1 + b e_2$ and $ge_2 = c e_1 +d e_2$ where $a,d \in R$ and $c \in \pi R\subset R$, while $b \in \pi^\inv R\supset R$.
    \item Set $J_0 = K_0 \cap K_1$, the joint stabilizer of $L_0$ and $L_1$. An element $g = \tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} \in \SL(2,k)$ lies in $J_0$ if and only if $a,d \in R^\times$, $b \in R$, and $c \in \pi R$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{proposition}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\SL(2,k)$ is generated by $N=T\cup w_0 T = N_{\SL(2,k)}(T)$ and $J_0$.
        \item $J_0 \cap N = T(R)$ is normal in $N$
        \item For $w=w_i T(R) \in  \tilde{W} = N/T(R)$, then for $j=0,1$, one has
              \begin{align*}
                  w_j J_0 & \subset J_0 w \cup J_0 w_j w J_0               \\
                  w_j J_0 & \subset J_0 w_i T(R) \cup J_0 w_jw_i T(R) J_0.
              \end{align*}
        \item For $j=0,1$, one has $w_j J_0 w_j \not\subset J_0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
Let $\bar{U}$ be the unipotent opposite to $U$.
\begin{lemma}
    $J_0 = \overline{U}(\pfrak) T(R) U(R) = U(R) T(R) \overline{U}(\pfrak)$ with uniqueness of expression.
\end{lemma}
For if $ad-bc=1$ with $a,d \in R^\times$, $b \in R$ and $c \in \pi R$, then
\begin{align*}
    \tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} & = \tbt{1}{0}{ca^\inv}{1}\tbt{a}{0}{0}{a^\inv}\tbt{1}{ba^\inv}{0}{1} \\
                     & = \overline{u}(ca^\inv)d(a)u(ba^\inv)
\end{align*}
is the decomposition claimed.
\begin{lemma}
    For $i =0,1$ , one has
    \begin{align*}
        K_i & = J_0 \cup J_0 w_i J_0                                \\
            & = (K_0\cap K_1) \cup (K_0 \cap K_1) w_i (K_0\cap K_1)
    \end{align*}
\end{lemma}
For $i=0$, this follows from the Bruhat decomposition in $\SL(2,\ffrak)$.
The matrix $g = \tbt{0}{1}{\pi}{0}$ normalizes $J_0$, and satisfies $g L_0 = L_1$, so that $gK_0g^\inv = K_1$.
\begin{lemma}
    Suppose $H$ is a proper subgroup of $\SL(2,k)$ containing $J_0 = K_1 \cap K_2$. Then $H = K_1$, $K_2$, or $J_0$.  Each of $K_1,K_2$,$J_0$ is equal to its normalizer in $\SL(2,k)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}[Iwaswa decomposition]
    $\SL(2,k) = K_0 \tbt{\pi}{}{}{\pi^\inv}^\Zbb U$: each $g \in \SL(2,k)$ has a unique factorization as $g=k_0(g) \tbt{\pi}{}{}{\pi^\inv}^{i(g)}u(x(g))$ where $k_0(g) \in K_0$, $i(g) \in \Zbb$, and $x(g) \in k$.
\end{lemma}
\section*{tree stuff}
Fix $x\in k$, and write, for $m,n \in \Zbb$,
\begin{align*}
    g(x,m,n) & = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
                               \varpi^m & x        \\
                               \circ    & \varpi^n
                           \end{array}\right]                                                \\
             & =\left[\begin{array}{ll}
                              1     & x \\
                              \circ & 1
                          \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
                                                      \varpi^{m-n} & \circ \\
                                                      \circ        & 1
                                                  \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
                                                                              \varpi^n & \circ    \\
                                                                              \circ    & \varpi^n
                                                                          \end{array}\right]
\end{align*}
Then $g(x,m,n)v_0 = \left\langle\left\langle\varpi^m e_1, e_2+x e_1\right\rangle\right\rangle$. For any fixed $n$, as $m\to \infty$, the sequence of vertices $g(x,m,n)v_0$ converges to the point $x=(1:x) \in \Pbb^1(k)$, and as $m \to -\infty$, $g(x,m,n)v_0$ converges to $\infty = (0:1) \in \Pbb^1(k)$. As $m$ varies along $\Zbb$, the vertices $g(x,m,n)v_0 = L_m^0(x)$ vary along the apartment $L^0(x)$ between the ends $\infty$ and $x$ in $\Pbb^1(k)$.
Note that $L^0(0)$ is the standard apartment $\Acal$, connecting $0$ and $\infty$. If $x \neq 0$ has $\ord x = m$, then $L_n^0(x) \in \Acal$ if and only if $n \leq m$.
\subsection{notation}
For a lattice $L$, write $\sdang{L}$ for the corresponding node in BT tree.
If $\{u,v\}$ is a basis of $k^2$, write $\left[ \left[ u,v \right] \right]$ for the lattice they span, and $\sdang{u,v}$ for the corresponding node.
For a field $F$, we describe $\Pbb^1(F)$ as follows: we embed $F$ in $\Pbb^1(F)$ by sending $x\in F$ to the line through $(x,1)$ and write $\infty$ for the line through $(1,0)$. Then $\Pbb^1(F) = F \cup \infty$.
The neighbors of a node $\sdang{u,v}$, take the form $\sdang{\pi u , x u + v}$ for $x\in R/\pfrak$ along with $\sdang{u,\pi v}$.
Set $u_0 = (1,0)$ and $v_0 = (0,1)$, and define the sequence of nodes $\nu_m=\left\langle\left\langle\varpi^m u_0, v_0\right\rangle\right\rangle=\left\langle\left\langle u_0, \varpi^{-m} v_0\right\rangle\right\rangle$ for $m \in \Zbb$.
\subsubsection*{fixed subtrees}
Let $[x,y]$ be a geodesic segment of length $\ell$. Pick a basis $(u,v)$ for a lattice $L_x$ representing $x$ so that the lattice spanned by $(u,\pi^\ell v)$ represents $y$. In this basis, the stabilizer of the $r$-ball $B([x,y],r)$ about $[x,y]$ in $\GL(2,k)$ is
\begin{align*}
    \Gamma(B([x,y],r)) & =k^\times \{ \tbt{a}{b}{c}{d}\in \GL(2,R): a-1=d-1=b=0 \mod \pfrak^r, c=0\mod \pfrak^{r+\ell} \} \\
                       & = \Gamma(\pfrak^r) \cap \Gamma_0(\pfrak^{r+\ell})
\end{align*}
\section*{actions}
\subsection*{representations}
Let $V=k^2$ and set $V^*=\Hom(V,k)$, and for nonzero $v\in V$ we let $v^* \in V^*$ be the functional satisfying $v^*(v) = 1$ and $v^*(w) = 0$ if $w \notin kv$.
We let $g$ act on $V$ from the left, and on $V^*$ from the right, so that $\lambda (g v) = (\lambda g)(v)$ for all $g\in G$, $v\in V$, $\lambda \in V^*$.
Let $p: k^2\setminus \{ 0 \} \to \Pbb(k^2)$ be the canonical projection, sending a nonzero vector in $k^2$ to the $k$-linear subspace that it spans.
\section*{claims}
\begin{proposition}
    Suppose $H$ is a subgroup of $\SL(2,R)$ such that, for all $h\in H$, one has $\tr(h)^2 - 4 \mod \pfrak^n$ is a square (potentially $0$). Then there exists an element $g \in \GL(2,k)$ such that $gHg^\inv \leq K_0(\pfrak^n)$.
\end{proposition}
\end{document}
Given $x\in M$, let $\rho_x(y)$ denote the distance from $x$ to $y$ relative to the metric induced by $g$.  Then one may express the heat invariants $a_n(x)$ by the formulae \cite[Theorem 1.2.1]{polterovichHeatInvariantsRiemannian2000}:
\begin{align}
    a_n(x) = \left.(4 \pi)^{-d / 2}(-1)^n \sum_{j=0}^{3 n}\left(\begin{array}{c}

                                                                        j+\frac{d}{2}
                                                                    \end{array}\right) \frac{1}{4^j j !(j+n) !} \Delta^{j+n}\left(\rho_x(y)^{2 j}\right)\right|_{y=x}
\end{align}
\newpage
Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$, and let $\Gamma(TM)$ denote the real vector space of smooth vecotr fields on $M$. For $X,Y \in \Gamma(TM)$, let $(X|Y) \in C^\infty(M)$ be given by $(X|Y)(p) = g_p(X_p,Y_p)$ for $p \in M$. Then the pairing
\begin{align*}
    \ip{X}{Y} = \int_M (X|Y) \dop v_g
\end{align*}
makes $\Gamma(TM)$ into a pre-hilbert space.
More generally if $E \to M$ is a vector bundle, which is equipped with an inner product $(\cdot | \cdot)_p$ on its fibers $E_p$, we can similarly define an inner product $\ip{\cdot}{\cdot}$ on the space $\Gamma(E)$ of smooth section of $E$.
\newpage
A vector field $X \in \Gamma(TM)$ ammounts to an operator $C^\infty(M) \to C^\infty(M)$ such that $X(fg)= X(f)g+fX(g)$ in the sense that $X(fg)\vert_m = X(f)\vert_m g(m) + f(m) X(g)\vert_m$ for all $m \in M$. Note That the composition of two vector fields $X,Y$, as endomorphisms of $C^\infty(M)$ will not itself be a vector field. Nonetheless, the operator $f \mapsto X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))$ is a vector field.
If $V$ is a vectorspace, then a tensor of type $(0,s)$ over $V$ is a an $s$-multilinear form on $V\times\dots \times V$ and a tensor of type $(r,0)$ is just an element of $V \otimes \dots \otimes V$.
A quadratic form on $V$ is a $(0,2)$ tensor which is moreover symmetric.
The curvature tensor is a $(1,3)$ form, but can be changed into a $(0,4)$ tensor. The former perspective allows for the interpretation of the curvature tensor as an exterior $2$-form valued in $\End(TM) = \Otimes^{1,1} TM$ ``since 3=1+2''.
To check that a multilinear form $m \mapsto \alpha(X_1,\dots X_k)(m)$ depends only on the values $X_1(m),\dots X_k(m)$ (and not on derivatives of such elements), it suffices to check that $\alpha(X_1 ,\dots, fX_i,\dots, X_k) = f \alpha(X_1 ,\dots, X_i,\dots, X_k)$ for every $i$ and any $f\in C^\infty(M)$.
Now suppose $g$ is a Riemannian metric on $M$, For a vector $v$ define a $1$-form $v^*$ by the rule $v^*(x)=g(v,x)$ for all vectors $x$, and for a $1$-form $\alpha$, define a vector $\alpha_*$ by the condition$ \alpha(v)=g(\alpha_*,v)$ for any vector $v$.
The gradient of a function is given by $\nabla f = (df)^* \in \Gamma(TM)$ (as $df \in \Gamma(T^*M)$), which is to say $g(\nabla f, x) = \dop f (x)$ for any vector field $x$.% !TeX root = main.tex
\section{Geometric Preliminaries}
\paragraph{Laplace-spectrum}
Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manmifold. The eigenvalues of the Laplace operator of the Laplace operator $\Delta_{M,g}$ acting on $L^2(M,\dop \Vol_g)$ form a discrete sequence of nonnegative real numbers which we encode via the discrete measure $\spec_{M,g}$ on $\Rbb$ which assigns to each $\lambda \in \Rbb$, the dimension of the $\lambda$-eigenspace $E_{M,g}(\lambda)=\ker (\Delta_{M,g}- \lambda \id)$ in $L^2(M, \dop \Vol_g)$. The pectrum $\spec_{M,g}$ is an invariant of the Riemannian structure on $M$.
We say that two Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ and $(M',g')$ are \textbf{isospectral} if $\spec_{M,g} = \spec_{M,g'}$. We say that $(M,g)$ is \textbf{spectrally rigid} in the absolute sense, if any Riemannian manifold which isospectral to $(M,g)$ is in fact isometric to $(M,g)$.
\paragraph{Arithmetic $2-$ and $3-$ manifolds}
Throughout $k$ will denote a number field, and $R$ its ring of integers. We write $V_k$ for its set of places, and write $\nu \in V_k^\infty$ (resp. $\nu \in V_k^f$) if $\nu$ is archimedian (resp. nonarchimedian).
We identify nonarchimedian places $\nu \in V_k^f$ with discrete valuations $\nu : k \to \Zbb$ on $k$ and in turn, prime ideals $\pfrak = \{ x \in k: \nu(x) > 0\}$ in $R$.
For a place $\nu \in V_k$ we write $k_\nu$ for the corresponding local field, and if $\nu \in V_k^f$ corresponding to a prime ideal $\pfrak$ of $R$ we write $R_\nu$ or $R_\pfrak$ for the closure of $R$ in $k_\nu$.
We say $\nu \in V_k^\infty$ is real (resp. complex) and write $\nu \in V_k^{\infty,\Rbb}$ (resp. $V_k^{\infty,\Cbb}$) if $k_\nu \approx \Rbb$ (resp. $\Cbb$)
% We denote by $\Abb_k$ the ring of adeles of $k$. 
Let $A$ be a quaternion algebra over $k$. We say that $A$ \textbf{ramifies} over a place $\nu \in V_k$, and write $\nu \in \Ram A$, if $A_\nu = A \otimes_k k_\nu$ is a division algebra, and otherwise \textbf{unramified} in which case $A_\nu \approx M(2,k_\nu)$.
By class field theory, the set $\Ram A$ of places over which $A$ ramifies is a finite set with even cardinality. Conversely, given any finite set $S \subset V_k$ of even cardinality and such that $S\cap V_k^{\infty,\Cbb}=\emptyset$ there is a unique quaternion algebra $A$ with $\Ram A = S$, up to isomorphism.
Associate to the quaternion algebra $A$ the algebraic groups over $k$ defined by
\begin{align*}
    \tilde{\Gbf}(E) = (A\otimes_k E)^\times,\quad \Gbf (E) = (A\otimes_k E)^1,\quad  \bar{\Gbf}(E) = E^\times \lmod (A\otimes_k E)^\times
\end{align*}
for any commutative $k$-algebra $E$. If $\Hbf$ is any of $\Gbf$, $\tilde{\Gbf}$, or $\bar{\Gbf}$, we write $H$ for $\Hbf(k)$, $H_\nu$ for $\Hbf(k_\nu)$, and $H_{\Abb_k}$ for $\Hbf(\Abb_k)$.
\begin{definition}
    We say $A$ is of
    \begin{itemize}
        \item    \textbf{Fuchsian-type} if: $k$ is totally real, and $A$ is unramified over exactly one real place $\nu_o$. In thise case, we use $\nu_o$ to identify $k$ with a subfield of $\Rbb$, and replace $\nu_o$-subscripts with $\Rbb$. Thus if $A$ is of fuchsian type, one has
              \begin{align}\label{eq:Fuchsian}
                  G_\Rbb \approx \GL(2,\Rbb),\quad G_\Rbb \approx \SL(2,\Rbb),\quad  \bar{G}_\Rbb \approx \PGL(2,\Rbb)
              \end{align}
        \item \textbf{Kleinian-type} if: $k$ has exactly one complex place $\nu_o$, and $A$ is ramified over all real places. In this case, use $\nu_o$ to identify $k$ with a subfield of $\Cbb$, and replace $\nu_o$-subscripts with $\Cbb$. Thus if $A$ is of Kleinian type, one has
              \begin{align}\label{eq:Kleinian}
                  G_\Cbb \approx \GL(2,\Cbb),\quad G_\Cbb \approx\SL(2,\Cbb),\quad  \bar{G}_\Cbb \approx \PGL(2,\Cbb)
              \end{align}
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
If $A$ is a quaternion algebra of Fuchsian or Kleinian type, we pick once and for all the isomorphisms in \ref{eq:Fuchsian} and \ref{eq:Kleinian}  respectively.
Recall that an order in a quaternion algebra $A$ over $k$ is a subring $O$ containing $R$ such that $kO = A$. For any order $O$, we affine group schemes over $R$ by
\begin{align*}
    \Gambfti_O(S) = (O\otimes_R S)^\times, \quad \Gambf_0(S) = (O\otimes_R S)^1, \quad \Gambfbar_O = S^\times \lmod (O\otimes_R S)^\times
\end{align*}
for any $R$-algebra $S$. Using the inclusion $R \to k$, we identify $\Gambf_O(R)$ with a subgroup $\Gamma_O$ of $G=\Gambf_O(k)$.
\begin{proposition}
\end{proposition}
For an ideal $\afrak$ of $R$, the reduction map $R \to R/\afrak$ induces an epimorpshim of groups $\Gamma \to \Gambf (R/\afrak)$. We write $\Gamma_O(\afrak)$ for the kernel, and refer to it as the \textbf{principal congruence subgroup of level } $\afrak$ in $\Gamma_O$. To summarize, for each ideal $\afrak$ of $R$, there is a short exact sequence of groups
\begin{align*}
    1 \to \Gamma_O (\afrak) \to \Gamma_O=\Gambf_O(R) \to \Gambf (R/\afrak) \to 1.
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
    \Gamma_O(\afrak) = \{ g \in O^1: g \in 1 + \afrak O\}
\end{align*}
and $\Gambf (R/\afrak)$ is a fintie group. We define principal congruence subgroups $\Gamti$ and $\Gambar$ similarly.
We say that $O$ is a maximal order in $A$ if it is not properly contained in any other order. Maximal orders exist in any quaternion algebra over $k$. The group $\Gti = A^\times$ (through its quotient $\Gbar = k^\times \lmod A^\times$) on the set of maximal orders in $A$. We say that $A$ has  \textbf{type-number 1} if this action is transitive, i.e. all maximal orders in $A$ are conjugate by an element of $A^\times$.
% Note that at each place $\nu \in V_k \setminus \Ram(A)$ one has isomorphisms
% \begin{align*}
%     \tilde{\Gbf}(k_\nu)\approx \GL(2,k_\nu),\quad \Gbf(k_\nu) \approx \SL(2,k_\nu), \bar{\Gbf}(k_\nu) \approx \PGL(2,k_\nu).
% \end{align*}
\newpage
Let $(M,g)$ be a $d$-dimensional closed Riemannian manifold without boundary.  Letting $\dop \Vol_g$ denote the measure on $M$ associated to the volume form of $(M,g)$, we equip the space $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth complex valued functions on $M$ with the inner product
\begin{align}\label{eq:ip}
    \ip{f}{g} = \int_M f(x) \overline{g}(x) \dop \Vol_g(x)
\end{align}
and let $L^2(M,g)$ denote the completion of $C^\infty(M)$ with respect to the resulting norm.
The \textbf{Laplace-Beltrami operator} $\Delta$ acts on $C^\infty(M)$, in local coordinates $(x_1,\dots,x_d)$, by the formula
\begin{align}
    \Delta(f) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \sum_{i,j=1}^d \frac{\partial \sqrt{g} g^{ij} (\partial f / \partial x_i)}{\partial x^j}
\end{align}
where $g = \det(g_{ij})$ and $(g^{ij})$ denotes the inverse of the matrix $(g_{ij})$. With respect to the inner product in \ref{eq:ip}, $\Delta$ is symmetric:
\begin{align*}
    \ip{\Delta f}{g} =\ip{ f}{\Delta g}, \quad \text{ for all $f,g \in C^\infty(M)$,}
\end{align*}
negative:
\begin{align*}
    \ip{\Delta f }{f} \leq 0, \quad \text{ for all $f \in C^\infty(M)$.}
\end{align*}
and unbounded. As $M$ is compact and without boundary, $\Delta$ admits a unique maximal extension to a negative, self-adjoint, unbounded operator  $\tilde{\Delta}$ on $L^2(M,g)$ with compact resovent.
By the spectral theorem for the latter class of operators, it follows that the resolvent set
\begin{align*}
    \sigma(\tilde{\Delta}) = \{ \lambda \in \Cbb : \tilde{\Delta} - \lambda \id \text{ is not invertible on $L^2(M,g)$}\}
\end{align*}
is a discrete set of nonnegative real numbers, accumulating at $-\infty$, and consists of eigenvalues of $\tilde{\Delta}$ with finite multiplicites. By elliptic regularity, any eigenfunction of $\tilde{\Delta}$ is smooth, and thus lies in the original domain $C^\infty(M)$ of $\Delta$. Consequently, $\sigma(\tilde{\Delta})$ coincides with the set
\begin{align*}
    \sigma(\Delta) = \{\lambda \in \Cbb : \Delta f  = \lambda f \text{ admits a nonzero  solution  $f \in C^\infty(M)$}.
\end{align*}
Set $E(\lambda) = \ker \Delta - \lambda \id$ and set $m(\lambda) = \dim E(\lambda)$. [TODO:finish rambling]
\paragraph{Heat kernel}
Let $\phi_0=\Vol(M)^{-1},\phi_1,\phi_2,\cdots$ be an orthonormal sequence of eigenfunctions for $\Delta$ corresponding to eigenvalues $\lambda_0=0 <\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \dots$. For $t >0$, the \textbf{heat kernel}
\begin{align}\label{eq:heatdef}
    K_t(x,y):= \sum_{j\geq 0} e^{-t\lambda_j} \phi_j(x)\phi_j(y)
\end{align}
is the unique function $k:\Rbb_{\geq 0} \times M \times M \to \Rbb$ satisfying the properties
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each fixed $y\in M$, one has $\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \Delta \right)k_t(x,y) = 0$
    \item For each $u\in C^\infty(M)$, one has $ \int_M k_t(x,y) u(y)  \dop \Vol_g (x)(y) \to u(x)$  as $t \to 0^+$, uniformly in $x$
    \item $k_t(\cdot,\cdot)$ is $C^2$ in $(x,y)$ for each $t$
    \item $k_\cdot( x,y)$ is $C^1$  in $t$ for each $(x,y)$.
\end{enumerate}
In particular, the heat kernel $K_t(x,y)$ is independent of the choice of orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions in the defining equation \ref{eq:heatdef}.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:asymptoticExpansion}
    Let $(M,g)$ be a compact $d$-dimensional Riemanniannian manifold without boundary, and let $K_t(x,y)$ be its heat kernel.  There exist a sequence of smooth functions $\abf_0,\abf_1, \abf_2,\cdots$ on $M$ such that
    \begin{align}\label{eq:asymptoticExpansion}
        K(t,x,x) \sim t^{-d/2}\left(\abf_0(x)+ \abf_1(x) t + \abf_2(x) t^2 +\cdots  \right)
    \end{align}
    as $t \to 0^+$. For each $n$, the function $\abf_n$ is a homogeneous polynonmial of degree $2n$ in the derivatives of the metric $g$.
    In particular,
    \begin{align}
        \abf_0 & = 1,                                                       \\
        \abf_1 & =\frac{1}{6} \tau,                                         \\
        \abf_2 & =\frac{1}{360}\left( 5\tau^2 - 2 |\rho|^2 +2 |R|^2 \right)
    \end{align}
    where $\tau \in C^\infty(M)$ is the scalar curvature,j

\subsubsection{Riemannian geometry}
Given a smooth manifold $M$ a Riemannian metric on $M$ is a choice of positive definite symmetric bilinear forms
\[g_x{\cdot}{\cdot}: T_x M \otimes T_x M, \to \Rbb\]
on the tangent space $T_x M$ to $M$, which varies smoothly relative to $x\in M$. We call to the pair $(M,g)$ a Riemannian manifold, or a Riemannian structure on $M$.
%     Fixing $(M,g)$ introduces several canonically associated fobjects, as follows:
% \subfsection{length} 
%     For a curve $\gamma$ on $M$, define its length:
%         \[ \ell_g(\gamma) = \int_{a}^{b} g_{r(t)}(r'(t),r'(t)) \dop t, \]
%     where $r:[a,b] \to \gamma$ is any smooth parameterization of $\gamma$.  
Canonically ssociated to a metric $g$ on $M$ are several objects:
\begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{gradient}] The gradient is an operator $\nabla: C^\infty(M) \to  \Gamma(TM)$ sending a smooth function $f$ to the vector field $\nabla f$ characterized by the condition: \[ g_x(\nabla f(x),X(x))=X_x(f) \]
        for all vectorfields $X \in \Gamma(TM)$.
    \item[\textbf{codifferential}] $\delta$
    \item[\textbf{hodge star}] $*:\bigwedge^k T^* M \to \bigwedge^{\dim M - k} T^*M$
    \item[textbf{volume form}] $\dop \vol : \bigwedge^{\dim M} T^* M \to \Rbb$
    \item[\textbf{density}] $|\dop \vol|$
    \item[Laplacian] $\Delta$
\end{description}
\section{Spectral geometry}
\subsection{Laplace spectrum}
Using the Riemannian density, we equip $C^\infty_c(M)$ with an inner product:
\[ \ip{\phi}{\psi} = \int_M f(x) \overline{g(x)} |\dop \Vol|(x). \]
We define $L^2(M)$ to be the completion of $C^\infty(M)$ with respect to this inner product.
On $C^\infty(M)$ the Laplace operator $\Delta$ is a densely defined, negative semi-definite, and symmetric:
\[ \ip{\Delta \phi}{\psi} = - \ip{\phi}{\Delta \psi} \]
unbounded operator on $L^2(M)$. Consequently, $\Delta$ admits a canonical (though, not necessarily unique, if $M$ is not compact) to a an unbounded operator $\tilde{\Delta}$ defined on a dense subspace of $L^2(M)$ on which it is \textit{self-adjoint}. If we assume further that $M$ is closed, then the $\tilde{\Delta}$ has \textit{compact} resolvent. By the spectral theorem for compact self adjoint operators, there exists an orthonormal basis $1=\psi_1,\psi_2,\cdots$ of eigenfunctions for $\tilde{\Delta}$ with real, nonpositive eigenvalues $0=\lambda_1>\lambda_2>\cdots$. By elliptic regularity, the eigenfunctions $\psi_i$ of the extension $\tilde{\Delta}$ are actually smooth, thus lie in the original domain $C^\infty(M)$ of $\Delta$.
We refer the sequence $\lambda_i$ of eigenvalues for $\Delta$ as the \textbf{Laplace-spectrum} of $M$ and write it as $\LaSpec(M)$.
It will be useful to encode $\LaSpec(M)$ in various other forms.
\begin{description}
    \item[multiplicity function] Denote by $m_M: \Cbb \to \Zbb_{\geq 0}$ the function which assigns to a complex number $\lambda$ the number of indices $i\in \Zbb_{\geq 0}$ such that $\lambda_i = \lambda$; an alternative description is:
        \[m_M(\lambda) = \dim \ker_{C^\infty(M)}( \Delta - \lambda) \]
    \item[spectral measure] Letting $\delta_x$ denote the dirac delta distribution on $C^\infty(\Cbb)$ based at $x$, we set
        \begin{align*}
            \dop m_M = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \delta_{\lambda_i}.
        \end{align*}
    \item[theta] Define $\Theta_M: \Rbb_{>0} \to \Rbb$ by
        \begin{align*}
            \Theta_M(t) & = \sum_{i=1}^\infty e^{t\lambda_i}           \\
                        & = \int_\Cbb e^{t \lambda} \dop m_M (\lambda)
        \end{align*}
    \item[Minakshisundaram--Pliejel zeta] Define, for $s$ in a suitable right half-plane,
        \begin{align*}
            \zeta_M(s) & = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \lambda_{i}^{-s}        \\
                       & = \int_\Cbb \lambda^{-s} \dop m_M(\lambda).
        \end{align*}
\end{description}
\subsection{Length spectrum}
In this section, we suppose that the Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ has strictly negative curvature.
In this case, within each free homotopy class of curve on $M$, there is a unique element with minimal length with respect to $g$. This representative is a geodesic on $M$, and we refer to it as the \textbf{geodesic representative} of a free homotopy class of curve. For any point $x_o \in M$, there is an identification of the set of free homotopy classes of curves with conjugacy classes in the fundamental group $\pi_1(M,x_o)$ based at $x_o$. Consequently, the Riemannian metric induces a class function $\ell_g: \pi_1(M,x_o) \to \Rbb$.
% \subsubsection{topological preliminaries}
%     For a connected, locally simply connected topological spaces $X$, we let $\tilde{X}$ denote the universal cover. For each point $x_o \in X$ the fundamental group $\pi_1(X,x_o)$ acts freely on $\tilde{X}$ by homeomorphisms preserving the fibers of $\tilde{X} \to X$. It follows that the projection $\tilde{X} \to X$ induces a homeomorphism $\pi(X,x_o)\lmod \tilde{X} \to X$. Consequently, for any topological space $Y$, we may identify $C(X,Y)$ with the subpsace $C(\tilde{X} , Y)^{\pi_1(X)}$ of $C(X,Y)$ of functions on $\tilde{X}$ invariant under $\pi_1(X)$. If $f \in C(X,Y)$ is a function, we write $\tilde{f}$ for the corresponding function on $\tilde{X}$. 
%     When $(M,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold, the lift $\tilde{g}$ of the metric to $\tilde{M}$ is the unique one such that the universal covering map $\tilde{M} \to M$ is a local isometry. 
% Taking $\Rbb/\Zbb$ as a model for the circle $S^1$, we identify the space $\Lcal(M)$ of continuous maps $S^1 \to M$ with the space $C(\Rbb,M)^\Zbb$ of continuous functions $f: \Rbb \to M$ which are invariant under the action of $\Zbb$ (by precomposition with translation). The Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ induces a  \textbf{length function} $\ell_g : \Lcal(M) \to \Rbb_{\geq 0}$. 
% Fixing a point $x_o \in M$, let $\Lcal_{x_o} (M)$ denote the subspace of $\Lcal(M)$ consisting of those $f$ satisfying $f(0)=x_o$. We refer to elements of $\Lcal_{x_o} (M)$ as \textit{loops based at $x_o$}. For loops $\gamma,\gamma':\Lcal_{x_o}(M)$, define their concatenation $\gamma \cdot \gamma' \in \Lcal_{x_o} (M)$ by the rule 
% \begin{align}
%     \left(\gamma \cdot \gamma' \right)(t)=   \begin{cases}\gamma_0(2 t) & 0 \leq t \leq \frac{1}{2} \\ \gamma_1(2 t-1) & \frac{1}{2} \leq t < 1\end{cases}
% \end{align}

\section{Arithmetic locally symmetric spaces}
This section will follow the presentation in \cite{helgasonDifferentialGeometryLie2001}.
\subsection{Locally symmetric spaces}
Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold, and $x\in M$. Let $N_0 \subset (T M)_x$ denote a neighborhood of $0$ which is stable under the map $v \mapsto -v$ and set $N_x = \exp_x N_0$ and small enough so that the map $\exp_x: N_0 \to N_p$ is a diffeomorphism.  For each point $y \in N_x$, let $\gamma_{x,y} : [0,1] \to N_p$ denote the unique geodesic segment satisfying $\gamma_{x,y}(0)=x$ and $\gamma_{x,y}(1)=y$. Set $s_x(y) = \gamma_{x,y}(-1)$. The map $s_x$ is a diffeomorphic involution on $N_x$, which we call the \textbf{geodesic symmetry} with respect to $x$. By design, it satisfies $(ds_x)_x = -\id \in \Aut((TM)_x)$.
\begin{defn}
    A Riemannian manifold $M$ is a \textbf{locally symmetric space} if each point $x\in M$ admits a neighborhood on which the geodesic symmetry $s_x$ is an isometry. A locally symmetric space is \textbf{globally symmetric} if for each point $x\in M$, the geodesic symmetry $s_x$ extends to a global isometry of $M$.
\end{defn}
When $(M,g)$ is Riemannian locally symmetric space for which the metric $g$ is complete, its universal cover $\tilde{M}$, when equipped with the pullback metric $\tilde{g}$, is globally symmetric. For any $x\in M$, the action of the fundamental group $\pi_1(M,x)$ on $\tilde{M}$ as group $\Gamma$ of deck transformations of $\tilde{M} \to M$ is by isometries (with respect to $\tilde{g}$, and induces an isomtery $\Gamma \lmod \tilde{M}\to M$. To summarize, all locally symmetric spaces arise as quotients $\Gamma \lmod X$ of globally symmetric spaces, where $\Gamma < \Isom(X)$ is a discrete subgroup acting freely on $X$.
As discussed in the next section,  we may realize any globally symmetric space $X$ as a quotient $G/K$ for a semisimple Lie group $G$ and a compact subgroup $K$.
Combining this claim with the preceeding paragraph, we conclude:
\begin{thm}
    Let $(M,g)$ be a locally symmetric space. Then there exists a semisimple Lie group $G$, a compact subgroup $K$, and a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of $G$ such that $(M,g)$ is isometric to $(\Gamma \lmod G \rmod K , B)$ where $B$ is a  $G$ invariant Riemannian metric on $G\rmod K$.
\end{thm}
\subsection{Symmetric spaces}
A Riemannian symmetric space is a Riemannian manifold $M$ such that, for each point $x\in M$, there exists a global involutive isometry $s_x \in \Isom(M)$ which fixes $x$ and induces the map $v \mapsto -v$ on the tangent space $(TM)_x$ at $x$. In this case, the group $G=\Isom(M)$
\begin{itemize}
    \item acts transitively on $M$,
    \item admits a unique structure as a smooth manifold, making it into a Lie group,
    \item if, for a point $x \in M$, we write $K_x$ for its stabilizer in $G$, then $K$ is a compact subgroup and the orbit map $G \to M$ sending $g$ to $gx$ induces a diffeomorphism $G/K_x \to M$,
    \item the map $\sigma_x: G \to G$ defined by $g \mapsto s_x g s_x$ is an involutory automorphism of $G$ such that $(G^{\sigma_x})^\circ \leq K_x \leq G^{\sigma_x}$ where $G^{\sigma_x}$ is the group of fixed points of $\sigma_x$, and $(G^{\sigma_x})^\circ$ its connected component containing the identity.
\end{itemize}
Fix $x \in M$ and supress it from the notation for $K$, $\sigma$, and $s$. Let $\gfrak$ be the Lie algebra of $G$. As $\sigma \in \Aut(G)$ is an involution, the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $(d\sigma)_e \in \Aut(\gfrak)$ and $\gfrak = \ker ((d\sigma)_e-1)\oplus \ker ((d\sigma)_e+1).$  From the third property above, one finds that the Lie algebra $\kfrak$ of $K$ is precisely the $+1$ eigenspace of $(d \sigma)_e$. Let $\pfrak$ denote the $-1$ eigenspace.
Letting $\pi : G \to M$ denote the orbit map $g \mapsto gx$ one finds that $\ker (d\pi)_e = \kfrak$, and it maps $\pfrak$ isomorphically to $T_x M$.  In particular, if $v \in \pfrak$, then the geodesic based at $x$ with tangent vector $(\dop \pi)_e v$ is given by $t \mapsto \exp (t v) x$. %Furhtermore, for $w \in (TM)_x$ the parallel translate of $w$ along this geodesic is given by $(d \exp (tv) )_x (w) $
Consequently the study of Riemannian globally symmetric spaces is tantamount to the study of \textbf{symmetric pairs} $(G,H)$, where $G$ is a connected Lie group, $H$ a compact subgroup such that there exists an involutory automorphism $\sigma \in \Aut(G)$ such that $(G^\sigma)^\circ \leq H \leq G^\sigma$.
\subsection{Arithmetic locally symmetric spaces}
% Arithmetic locally symmetric spaces are those which arise from a certain construction, which I now outline. First, we need some algebro-geometric background.
% \subsubsection{Affine schemes}
%    Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$. We associate to $R$ the topological space $X=\spec(R)$ defined as follows: 
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item The elements of $X$ are prime ideals $\pfrak \leq R$. 
%        \item For each ideal $\afrak\leq R$, let $V(\afrak)$ denote the set of prime ideals $\pfrak$ containing $\afrak$. Then we take the sets $V(\afrak)$ as the closed sets of $X$. Alternatively, if one defines, for $f\in R$, the set $D_f$ of prime ideals not containing $f$, one may take the set $\{D_f: f\in R\}$ as  basis for the topology on $X$. 
%    \end{itemize}
%    We equip the topological space $X=\spec (R)$ with a sheaf $O_{X}$ of rings, defined by specifying sections on the open sets $D_f$ as $\Gamma(D_f,O_X) = R_f$, the localization of $R$ with respect to the powers of $f$.
%    \begin{defn}
%        A pair $(X,O_X)$ consisting of a topological space $X$ and a sheaf of rings $O_X$ on $X$ is an \textbf{affine scheme} if $X=\spec(R)$ for some ring $R$.
%    \end{defn}
%    \begin{example}
%        The closure of a singleton $
%        \{\pfrak\} \subset X = \spec R$ is the set of prime ideals $\pfrak'$ containing $\pfrak$. It follows that the set $\{\pfrak\}$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $\pfrak$ is a maximal ideal of $R$.  
%    \end{example}
%    \begin{example}
%         For any ring $R$, the affine scheme $\Abb^n_R:=\spec(R[x_1,...,x_n])$ is called the $n$-dimensional affine space over $R$. There is a subset of $\Abb_R^n$ which may be identified with the familiar $R^n$, by associating to an $n$-tuple $(a_1,...,a_n)\in R^n$ the maximal ideal $\langle x_1 - a_1 , ...,x_n-a_n\rangle \in \Abb_n^R$. There are, however, always more points than these in $\Abb^n_R$.
%         % When $R=F$ is an algebraically closed field, the maximal ideals of $F[x_1,...,x_n]$ take the form $\langle x_1-a_1, ....,x_n-a_n\rangle$ for some $n$-tuple of elements $(a_1,...,a_n) \in F^n$.  Thus, only the \textit{closed points} of $\Abb^n_F$ may be identified with $F^n$.
%    \end{example}
% \subsubsection{General Schemes}
%    More generally, a \textbf{scheme} is a pair $(X,O_X)$ where $X$ is a topological space and $O_X$ is a sheaf of rings such that $X$ admits a covering $X = \bigcup_i U_i$ by open sets $U_i$ which are affine schemes. 
\section{Algebraic groups}
In this section $F$ is an arbitrary field.
\begin{defn}
    An algebraic group $\Gbf$ over $F$ is a group object in the category of schemes over $F$.
\end{defn}
We will freely identify such a $\Gbf$ with its \textbf{functor of points}:
\begin{align}
    X \mapsto \Gbf(X) = \Hom_F(X,\Gbf),
\end{align}
for any scheme $X$ over $F$. When $X=\spec A$ for $A$ a commutative $F$-algebra, then we abuse notation in writing $\Gbf(A)$ for $\Gbf(\spec(A))$.
Thus, we think of $\Gbf$ as a family of groups $\Gbf(A)$ parameterized by commutative $F$-algebras $A$, such that each $A \to B$ of $F$-algebras induces a group homomorphism $\Gbf(A)\to \Gbf(B)$.
In particular, the canonical inclusion $x\mapsto x \cdot 1_A \in A$ defining $A$ as an $F$-algebra, induces a canonical map $\Gbf(F) \to \Gbf(A)$.
\paragraph{$\Gbb_a,\Gbb_m$} The fundamental building blocks for linear algebraic groups over $F$ are the \textbf{additive group} $\Gbb_a$ and and \textbf{multiplicative group} $\Gbb_m$, which are defined by via their functor of points:
\begin{align}
    \Gbb_a(A)= (A,+),\quad \Gbb_m(A)=(A^\times,\cdot), \quad \text{for any $F$-algebra $A$.}
\end{align}
\paragraph{$\Autbf$:} if $\Gbf$ is any algebraic group over $F$, then the assignment
\begin{align}
    A\mapsto \Aut_{gp}(\Gbf(A))
\end{align}
defines an algebraic group, which we'll call $\Autbf_{gpsch}(\Gbf)$ [TODO: think about whether these automorphisms should fix/stabilize $\Gbf(F)$.]
The multiplicative structure of an algebra $A$ allows for a \textbf{canonical} inclusion $A^\times \to \Aut((A,+))$, which in turn yeilds a map of algebraic groups $\Gbf_m \to \Autbf(\Gbb_a)$.
\begin{rem}
    If one forgets about the group structure on $\Gbb_a$ and just considers it as a scheme, then one obtains the \textbf{affine line} $\Abb^1 = \spec(F[x])$  over $F$. The algebraic group $\Autbf_{sch}(\Abb^1)$ defined by $A \mapsto \Aut_{sch}(\Abb^1(F))$ is larger than $\Autbf_{gpsch}(\Gbb_a)$.
\end{rem}
The natural action of $A^\times$ on $A$ induces a homomorphism $\Gbb_m \to \Aut(\Gbb_a)$, of algebraic groups.

\subsubsection{Trace fields and quaternion algebras}
\begin{defn}
    Let $\Gamma$ be a nonelemnentary subgroup of $\PSL(2,\Cbb)$ and let $\hat{\Gamma} = P^\inv (\Gamma)$, where $P:\SL(2,\Cbb) \to \PSL(2,\Cbb)$. The \textbf{trace field} $\Qbb(\tr \Gamma)$ of $\Gamma$ is the field
    \begin{align*}
        \Qbb(\tr \hat{\gamma}: \hat{\gamma} \in \hat{\Gamma}).
    \end{align*}
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
    If $M$ is a finite volume hyperbolic $2$- or $3$-manifold, then there exists a lattice $\Gamma$ in $\PSL(2,\Rbb)$ or $\PSL(2,\Cbb)$ such that $M$ is isometric to $\Gamma \lmod \Hbb^2$ or $\Gamma \lmod \Hbb^3$, and the set of such $\Gamma$ consitutes a full $\PSL(2,\Rbb)$ or $\PSL(2,\Cbb)$ conjugacy class. Since $\Qbb(\tr \Gamma)$ is a conjugcay invariant of $\Gamma$, we may understand it as an invariant of the Riemannian manifold $M$.
\end{rem}
\begin{def/prop}
For a nonelementary subgroup $\Gamma \leq \PSL(2,\Cbb)$, let $A_0\Gamma\subset M(2,\Cbb)$ denote the algebra generated over $\Qbb(\tr \Gamma)$ by the elements $\hat{\gamma}$ for $\hat{\gamma} \in \hat{\Gamma}$. Then, in fact, $A_0\Gamma$ is a quaternion algebra over $\Qbb(\tr \Gamma)$.
\end{def/prop}
\begin{rem}
    As before, the isomorphism type of $A_0 \Gamma$ as a quaternion algebra over $\Qbb(\tr \Gamma)$ is an invariant of the hyperbolic $2$- or $3$-manifold that $\Gamma$ uniformizes.
\end{rem}
\subsubsection{Invariant trace fields and quaternion algebras}
While the trace field $\Qbb(\tr \Gamma)$, and the quaternion algebra $A_0 \Gamma$ over it, are invariants of the isometry class of the hyperbolic manifold associated to $\Gamma$, they are not constant along the commensurability class of $\Gamma$. The following construction refines the preceeding one to get a genuine commensurability invariant.
\begin{def/prop}
Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated non-elementaryy subgroup of $\PSL(2,\Cbb)$ and let $\Gamma^{(2)}$ denote the subgroup of $\Gamma$ generated by squares of elements of $\Gamma$. The trace field $\Qbb(\tr\Gamma^{(2)})$ of $\Gamma^{(2)}$ is an invariant of the commensurability class of $\Gamma$. We refer to it as the \textbf{invariant trace field} of $\Gamma$, and write it as $k\Gamma$.
Furthermore, the quaternion algebra $A_0\Gamma^{(2)}$ over $k\Gamma$ is an invariant of the commensurability class of $\Gamma$. We refer to it as the \textbf{invariant quaternion algebra} of $\Gamma$, and denote it by $A\Gamma$.
\end{def/prop}
\subsection{Arithmeticity}
Historically, arithmeticity of a lattice $\Gamma$ in a semisimple Lie group $G$ was defined by stipulating that $\Gamma$ be commensurable with groups arising from a particular construction, which we will detail in a moment.
This definition of arithmeticity for a lattice does not clearly reflect the sense in which it is an intrinsic property of the Riemannian geometry of the locally symmetric space that it uniformizes.
The following celebrated theorem of Margulis characterizes arithmeticity in terms of the existence of an abundant group of \textbf{virtual symmetries}.
To state this theorem, we first recall that the commensurator $\Comm_G(\Gamma)$ of a subgroup $\Gamma$ of a group $G$ is the group of elements $g\in G$ such that $g\Gamma g^\inv \cap \Gamma$ has finite index in both $\Gamma$ and $g\Gamma g^\inv $.
\begin{rem}\label{remark:hiddensymm}
    If $M=\Gamma \lmod G \rmod K$ is a locally symmetric space, then for an element $g \in \Comm_G(\Gamma)$, let $M' = (g\Gamma g^\inv) \cap \Gamma \lmod G / K$.  Then $M' \to M$ is a Riemannian cover, and $g$ induces an isometry of $M'$. When $g \notin N_G(\Gamma) \leq \Comm_G(\Gamma)$, then this isometry is not the lift one on $M$. In this case, following \cite{farbHiddenSymmetryArithmetic2004}, we say $g$ is a hidden symmetry of $M$.
\end{rem}
\begin{thm}%[Theorem (1) of \cite{margulisDiscreteSubgroupsSemisimple1991b}]
    Let $G =\PSL(2,\Rbb)$ or $G= \PSL(2,\Cbb)$. A lattice $\Gamma\leq G$ is arithmetic if and only if $\Comm_G(\Gamma)$ is dense in $G$. Equivalently, $\Gamma$ is arithmetic if it has infinite index in $\Comm_G(\Gamma)$.
\end{thm}
\subsection{Arithmetic lattices in SL(2,R)}
In this section, we will identify a particular representative of each commensurability class of arithmetic lattice in $\SL(2,\Rbb)$ or $\SL(2,\Cbb)$. Each of these represenatives will be maximal lattices, and will be uniquely detemrined by an explicit tuple of arithmetic datum. The main theorem will identify specific subgroups of these represenatives which are spectrally rigid, provided certain conditions on the arithemtic data are met.\paragraph{Local Computations}[\cite{hillRegularElementsRegular1995}]
In this section, $K$ is a nonarchimedian local field of characteristic $0$, with ring of integers $R$, maximal ideal $\pfrak$, with uniformizer $\varpi$ and residue field $k = R/\pfrak$ of cardinality $q$.
We let $\tilde{K}$ denote the maximal unramified extension of $K$ in some fixed algebraic closure, $\tilde{R}$ its ring of integers, and $\tilde{k}$ its residue field. We note that $\varpi \in R$ generates the maximal ideal of $\tilde{R}$, and that $\tilde{k}$ is an algebraic closure of $k$.
For $r\geq 1$, we write $R_r$ for $R/\varpi^r R$ and $\tilde{R}_r = \tilde{R}/\pi^r \tilde{R}$ and write $\eta_r : \tilde{R} \to \tilde{R}_r$ for the natural projection.
There is an automorphism $\sigma \in \Gal(\tilde{K}/K)$ which induces the frobenius automorphism $x \mapsto x^q$  of $\tilde{k}/k$. The subfield $\tilde{K}^\sigma $ of $\tilde{K}$ fixed by $\sigma$ is $K$.
As $\sigma$ preserves $\tilde{R}$ and $\pi \tilde{R}$, it induces automorphisms of each $\tilde{R}_r$ which we still denote by $\sigma$. For each $r\geq 1$ one has $\tilde{R}_r^\sigma = R_r$.
The Teichmuller character $s: \kti^\times \to \Rti^\times$ is characterized by the conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $s(ab)=s(a)s(b)$ for all $a,b\in \kti^\times$
    \item $\sigma s(a)=s(a^q)$ for all $a\in \kti^\times$
    \item $\eta_1 s(a) = a$ for all $a\in \kti^\times$.
\end{enumerate}
We extend $s$ to $\kti^\times$ by $s(0)=0$ and write $s_r = \eta_r \circ s : \kti \to \Rti_r$. Then each $x \in \Rti$ admits a unique representation as $x = \sum_{i\geq 0} s(x_i)\varpi^i$ for some $x_i \in \kti$. Likewise, each $x \in \Rti_r$ admits a unique representation $x = \sum_{i=0}^{r-1} s_r(x_i)(\pi +\pi^r \Rti)^i$.
Set $\Gbf = \GL(n, \Rti)$. For $r\geq 1$, set $\Gbf(r) = \GL(n,\Rti_r)$. We write $\eta_r: \Gbf \to \Gbf(r)$ for the natural projection, and set $\Kbf_r  = \ker \eta_r \leq \Gbf$.  For $r \geq i \geq 1$  write $\eta_i^r : \Gbf(r) \to \Gbf(i)$ for the natural projection, and set $\Kbf_r^i = \ker \eta_r^i \leq \Gbf(r)$.
The automorphism $\sigma \in \Gal(\Kti/K)$ induces an automorpshim, also denoted $\sigma$, of $\Gbf$ (resp. $\Gbf(r)$) with fixed group $G = \GL(n,R)$ (resp. $G(r) = \GL(n,R_r)$).
Let $G = \SL(2,R)$ and for $r>0$, set $G(r) = \SL(2,R/\pfrak^r)$ and write $\eta_r: G \to G(r)$ for the natural projection, and set $K_r = \ker \eta_r \leq G$. For $r \geq i \geq 1$, we write $\eta_i^r$ for the natural map $G(r) \to G(i)$ and write $K_i(r) = \ker \eta_i^r \leq G(r)$.% \newcommand{\LaSpec}{\operatorname{Spec}_\Delta}

\paragraph{Notation}
Throughout $k$ will denote a number field, and $R$ its ring of integers. We write $V_k$ for its set of places, and write $\nu \in V_k^\infty$ (resp. $\nu \in V_k^f$) if $\nu$ is archimedian (resp. nonarchimedian).
We identify nonarchimedian places $\nu \in V_k^f$ with discrete valuations $\nu : k \to \Zbb$ on $k$ and in turn, prime ideals $\pfrak = \{ x \in k: \nu(x) > 0\}$ in $R$.
For a place $\nu \in V_k$ we write $k_\nu$ for the corresponding local field, and if $\nu \in V_k^f$ corresponding to a prime ideal $\pfrak$ of $R$ we write $R_\nu$ or $R_\pfrak$ for the closure of $R$ in $k_\nu$. We denote by $\Abb_k$ the ring of adeles of $k$.
% If $A$ is an algebra over $k$, then we write $A_\nu$ for its completion as a $k_\nu$-algebra.  
If $A$ is an algebra over $k$, and $\nu \in V_k$ then we write $A_\nu$ for the $k_\nu$-algebra $A\otimes_k k_\nu$. If $S$ is a finite set of places, then we write $A_S = \prod_{\nu \in S} A_\nu$ and we write $A_{\Abb_k}= A \otimes_k \Abb_k$ for its adelic points.
We pick for each finite place $\pfrak$, once and for all, a uniformizer $\varpi \in R_\pfrak$ for its unique maximal ideal.
For an integral ideal $\afrak$ in $R$, we write $\pi_\afrak : R \to R/\afrak$ for the reduction map.
\subsubsection{Theorem}
Let $k \leq \Rbb$ be a totally real number field, and $A$ a quaternion algebra over $k$ which is unramified over the identity embedding $k\to \Rbb$, and ramified over all other infinite places.
If $B$ is a subring of $A$, we write $B^1$ for the multiplicative subgroup of $A^\times$ consisting of elements of $B$ with reduced norm $1$.
We associate to the quaternion algebra $A$ the algebraic groups over $k$ defined by
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\Gbf}(E) = (A\otimes_k E)^\times,\quad \Gbf (E) = (A\otimes_k E)^1,\quad  \bar{\Gbf}(E) = E^\times \lmod (A\otimes_k E)^\times
\end{align*}
for any commutative $k$-algebra $E$. Note that at each place $\nu \in V_k \setminus \Ram(A)$ one has isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{\Gbf}(k_\nu)\approx \GL(2,k_\nu),\quad \Gbf(k_\nu) \approx \SL(2,k_\nu), \bar{\Gbf}(k_\nu) \approx \PGL(2,k_\nu).
\end{align*}
An isomorphism $\phi : A\otimes_k \Rbb \to M(2,\Rbb)$ of algebras, restricts to an isomorphism $(A\otimes_k \Rbb)^1 \to \SL(2,\Rbb)$ of groups. Composing $\phi$ with the canonical projection $\SL(2,\Rbb)  \to \PSL(2,\Rbb)$ we obtain a homomorphism $\psi : A^1 \to \PSL(2,\Rbb)$ which factors through $\pm 1 \lmod A^1$.
For an order  $\Ocal \subset A$ in $A$, write $\Ocal^1 = A^1 \cap \Ocal$. We call the subgroup $\psi(\Ocal^1)\leq \PSL(2,\Rbb)$ the arithmetic Fuchsian group associated to the datum $k$,$A$,$\psi$,$\Ocal$.
We write this group as $\Gamma_{k,A,\psi,\Ocal}$, or just by $\Gamma_\Ocal$ if $k,A,\psi$ are fixed. A fuchsian group is \textbf{arithmetic} provided it is commensurable to one of the form $\Gamma_{k,A,\psi,\Ocal}$, and say that it is \textbf{derived} from the quaternion algebra $A$ if is a subgroup of some $\Gamma_{k,A,\psi,\Ocal}$.
% \begin{rem}
% 	Some comments about this definition:
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item Given any Fuchsian group $\Lambda$, there is at most one number field $k$, and quaternon algebra $A$ over $k$, such that $\Lambda$ is commensurable to $\psi(\Ocal^1)$ for some order $\Ocal$ in $A$. Thus, for arithmetic Fuchsian groups, the pair $(k,A)$ is a complete invariant of commensurability classes.
% 		\item If $\Lambda$ is an arithmetic lattice derived from the quaternion algebra $k,A$, then there are only finitely many orders $\Ocal$ in $A$ such that $\Lambda$ is contained in $\psi(\Ocal^1)$.
% 		\item For any order $\Ocal$ in a quaterion algebra $A$, the set of maximal orders containing $\Ocal$ is finite and nonempty.
% 	\end{enumerate}
% \end{rem}
For an integral ideal $\afrak$ in $R$, the map $\pi_\alpha: \Ocal \to \Ocal \otimes_R R/\afrak$ is a surjective ring homomorphism.
the \textbf{principal congruence subgroup } of level $\afrak$ in an order $\Ocal$ is the subgroup of $\Ocal^1$ given by
\begin{align*}
  \Ocal^1(\afrak) = \{ x \in \Ocal^1 : x - 1 \in \afrak \Ocal^1\}.
\end{align*}
We let $\pi_\afrak$ denote the projection $\Ocal^1 \to (\Ocal \otimes_R R/\afrak)^1$.   % there is a short exact sequence  \begin{align*} 1 \to \Ocal^1(\afrak) \to \Ocal^1 \to (\Ocal \otimes_R R/\afrak)^1 \to 1 \end{align*}
If $\Lambda$ is any subgroup of $\PSL(2,\Rbb)$ which is commensurable to $\psi(\Ocal^1)$, we write $\Lambda(\afrak,\Ocal)$, or just $\Lambda(\afrak)$ if $\Ocal$ is understood, for
\[\ker \pi_\alpha \vert_\Lambda = \Lambda \cap \psi(\Ocal^1(\afrak)) =\{g \in \Lambda: g \equiv 1 \mod \alpha\}\]
and write $\Lambda[\afrak]$ for its image. Thus,
\begin{align*}
  \Lambda / \Lambda(\afrak) =	\Lambda[\afrak] \leq O^1[\afrak]= O^1/O^1(\afrak)
\end{align*}
\begin{thm}
  Let $\Gamma=\Gamma_{k,A,O}$ denote a maximal arithmetic lattice in $G=\PSL(2,\Rbb)$, arising from the arithmetic datum $(k,A,O)$ (as above) such that $A$ has type number $1$. Let $\afrak$ be a squarefree ideal in $R_k$ which are not divisible by any prime over which $A$ ramifies, nor any dividing $2$ or $3$, the hyperbolic surface $X(\afrak)=\Gamma(\afrak) \lmod G \rmod K$ is absolutely spectrally rigid.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  In what follows, we suppose $M$ is a closed Riemannian manifold which is isospectral to $X(\afrak)$.
  \begin{claim}\label{claim:heat}
    The dimension, volume, and mean scalar curvature of $M$ and $X(I)$ coincide.
  \end{claim}
  \begin{lemma}
    Let $X$ be a Riemannian manifold, with Laplace spectrum $0\geq \lambda_0 \geq \lambda_1 \geq \cdots$, and let $K_X(t)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty e^{\lambda_i t}$. Then $K_X(t)$ admits an asymptotic expansion as $t\to 0^+$ of the form
    \[ K_X(t) \sim (4\pi t)^{-\dim(X)/2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(X) t^n \]
    for constants $a_i(X)$ which are integrals over $X$ of polynomials in the entries of the curvature tensor of $X$ and its covariant derivatives. The first two are:
    \[a_0(X) = \Vol(X),\quad a_1(X) = \frac{1}{6} \int_X \tr {\rm Ricc} (x) \dop \Vol(x).\]
  \end{lemma}
  Indeed, since $K_M(t) = K_{X(I)}(t)$ identically, we may read off the invariants in the claim from their common asymptotic expansions as $t\to 0^+$.
  \begin{rem}
    The total scalar curvature of a smooth, closed surface is its Euler characteristic by Gauss-Bonnet. As the euler characteristic is a complete invariant of the diffeomorphism type for closed surfaces, we may thus conclude that $M$ and $X(I)$ are in fact diffeomorphic.
  \end{rem}
  [TODO]: argue that $M$ must have constant negative curvature $=-1$. We'll do so either via one of the following routes:
  As $M$ is a compact hyperbolic $2$-manifold, it admits a Fuchsian uniformization $M \approx \Lambda \lmod \Hbb^2$, where $\Lambda$ is a uniform lattice in $\PSL(2,\Rbb)$.
  \begin{claim}
    After conjugating by an element of $\PSL(2,\Rbb)$ we may take $\Lambda$ to be a finite index subgroup of $\Gamma = \rho(O^1) \leq  \PSL(2,\Rbb)$.
  \end{claim}
  \begin{proof}
    This claim follows from two theorems.
    First, we apply the following theorem to conclude that $\Lambda$ is arithmetic.
    \begin{thm}[Takeuchi \cite{takeuchiCharacterizationArithmeticFuchsian1975}]\label{thm:takeuchi}
      Let $\Gamma$ be a Fuchsian group of the first kind. Then $\Gamma$ is an arithmetic Fuchsian group derived from a quaternion algebra if and only if $\Gamma$ satisfies the following conditions
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item The subfield $k$ of $\Cbb$, generated over $\Qbb$ by the traces of elements of $\Gamma$, has finite degree over $\Qbb$
        \item $\tr(\Gamma)$ is contained in the ring of integers $R_{k}$ of $k$
        \item For any isomorphism $\phi: k \to \Cbb$ such that $\phi \neq \id$, the set $\phi(\tr(\Gamma))$ is bounded in $\Cbb$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{thm}
    As these conditions are satisfied for $\Gamma(I)$, and $\tr(\Gamma(I)) = \tr(\Lambda)$, there are also satisfied for $\Lambda$. Thus, $\Lambda$ is a finite index subgroup of the norm one units of \emph{some} maximal order in \emph{some} quaternion algebra over $k$.
    The second theorem demonstrates that this quaternion algebra is in fact $A$.
    \begin{thm}[Reid \cite{reidIsospectralityCommensurabilityArithmetic1992}]
      Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be isospectral arithmetic hyperbolic $2$ or $3$ manifolds. Then $M_1$ and $M_2$ are commensurable.
    \end{thm}
    For arithmetic hyperbolic $2$- and $3$-manifolds, commsurability is tantamount to an isomorphism of invariant quaternion algebras.
    From theorem \ref{thm:takeuchi}, $\Lambda$ is contained in $\rho(O'^1)$ for some maximal order $O'$ in $A$. Since $A$ has type number $1$, all maximal orders in $A$ are conjugate (by an element of $A^\times$). Consequently we may take $O'=O$, so that $\Lambda \leq \Gamma = \rho(O^1)$ as claimed.
  \end{proof}
  \begin{lemma}\label{lemma:MangosteenPicosdeEuropa}
    Let $A$ be a quaternion algebra over a number field $k$ with ring of integers $R$, and let $O$ be a maximal order in $A$.
    Let $\pfrak$ be a prime ideal of $R$ over which $A$ is unramified.
    Suppose $\Lambda$ be a subgroup of $O^1$ satisfying
    \begin{align}\label{eq:trace}
      \tr g \equiv 2 \mod \pfrak^{2n}, \quad \text{for all $g \in \Lambda$}.
    \end{align}
    then there exists an $\alpha \in A^\times$ such that $\alpha \Lambda \alpha^\inv \subset O^1(\pfrak^n)$.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    As $A$ is unramified over $\pfrak$, there is an isomorphism
    \begin{align}\label{eq:split}
      O^1 \otimes R_\pfrak \approx SL(2,R_\pfrak)
    \end{align}, and $O^1[\pfrak^n] \approx \SL(2,R/\pfrak^n)$. Fixing an isomorphism in as \ref{eq:split}, we identify $O^1$ with a group of matrices $g = \tbt{a}{b}{c}{d}$ with entries $a,b,c,d \in \R_k$.
    % Picking a uniformizer $\varpi \in R_\pfrak$ for $\pfrak$, each $g\in O^1$ admits a unique decomposition
    % \begin{align}\label{eq:decomposition}
    %     % g                & = g_0 + g_1 \varpi + g_2 \varpi^2 + \dots                                                                \\
    %     \Tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} & =  \Tbt{a_0}{b_0}{c_0}{d_0} +\Tbt{a_1}{b_1}{c_1}{d_1} \varpi + \Tbt{a_2}{b_2}{c_2}{d_2} \varpi^2 + \dots
    % \end{align}
    % $O^1[\pfrak] \approx \SL(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$
    % for matrices $g_n \in M(2,R_\pfrak)$ at least one of each is not in $\pfrak$.
    We will argue by induction. For the base case, suppose $n=1$ so that $\tr(g) \equiv 2 \mod \pfrak^2$ for all $g \in \Lambda$.
    Write $\Lambda[\pfrak] = \pi_{\pfrak}(\Lambda)\leq \SL(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$. Now, as $\tr g \equiv 2 \mod \pfrak$ for all $g \in \Lambda$, it follows that each $h \in \Lambda[\pfrak]$ is unipotent.
    Indeed, by Cayley-Hamilton (in $M(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$) each element $h$ satisfies its characteristic polynomial $p(x;h)=x^2 - \tr h x + 1= (x-1)^2$.
    It follows that $\Lambda[\pfrak]$ is conjugate in $\SL(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$ to a subgroup of the group $U(\kfrak_\pfrak)$ of upper triangular unipotent matrices. As $O^1 \to O^1[\pfrak]\approx \SL(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$ is surjective, we may pull back any such conjugation to one in $O^1$.
    Thus, without any loss of generality, we may assume that each $g$ in $\Lambda$ may be written as
    \begin{align*}
      g = \Tbt{1}{x}{0}{1} + \varpi \gamma
    \end{align*}
    for some $\gamma = \tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} \in M(2, R_\pfrak)$.
    Since $\Lambda \leq O^1$, one has $\det g = 1 $ for all $g\in \Lambda$, thus
    \begin{align*}
      1 & = \det g                                     \\
        & = 1 + (a+d - cx ) \varpi + (ad -bc) \varpi^2
    \end{align*}
    so that
    \begin{align}\label{eq:MandarinLeyden}
      (a+d - cx) \varpi + (ad-bc) \varpi^2 =0.
    \end{align}
    By hypothesis (\ref{eq:trace}), we have $(a+d)\varpi = \tr g -2 \equiv 0 \mod \pfrak^2$ so that $a+d \in \pfrak$. Consequently, $xc \in \pfrak$. As $\pfrak$ is prime, it follows that at least one of $x,c$ lies in $\pfrak$. If $x \in \pfrak$, then $g \in O^1(\pfrak)$. If this is so for all $g \in \Lambda$ then the claim is proven. Supposing otherwise, there exists a $ g = \Tbt{1}{x}{0}{1} + \varpi \tbt{a}{b}{c}{d}$ for which $x \in R_\pfrak^\times$. In this case one has $c \in \pfrak$. Let $\alpha_o = \Tbt{\varpi}{0}{0}{1}$. Then
    \begin{align*}
      \alpha_o g\alpha_o^\inv  = \Tbt{1}{\varpi x}{0}{1} + \varpi \tbt{a}{\varpi b}{\varpi^\inv c}{d}
    \end{align*}
    lies in $O^1(\pfrak)$.
    To complete the proof of the base case, we must prove that there exists an element $\alpha \in A^\times $ such that $\alpha g \alpha^\inv =  \alpha_o g \alpha_o^\inv$. Note that multiplying $\alpha_o$ on the left by an element of $\GL(2,R_\pfrak)$ preserves the condition that $\alpha_o g \alpha_o^\inv \in O^1(\pfrak)$, so it suffices to prove that the intersection $\alpha_o \GL(2,R_\pfrak) \cap A^\times $ is nonempty. This, in turn, follows from the fact that $A^\times$ is dense in $\GL(2,k_\pfrak)$ and that the coset  $\alpha_o \GL(2,R_\pfrak)$ is open in $\GL(2,k_\pfrak)$.
    Before we proceed, we need the following lemmata:
    \begin{lemma}\label{lemma:iso}
      Suppose $n\geq 2$. Then there is an isomorphism of $O^1(\pfrak^{n-1}) / O^1(\pfrak^{n})$ with the underlying additive group of $\sl(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$ which intertwines the conjugation action of $O^1$ on the former with the adjoint action of $O^1$ on the latter.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      The isomorphism is given by composing the map $g = 1 + \varpi^{n-1}\gamma \mapsto \gamma$  of $O^1(\pfrak^{n-1}) \to M(2,R_\pfrak)$ with reduction modulo $\pfrak$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{lemma}\label{lemma:killingform}
      Let $\Ncal$ be the quadric in $\Pbb(\sl(2,\kfrak_\pfrak))\approx \Pbb^2(\kfrak_\pfrak)$, cut out by the equation $det X =0$. Then $\Ncal$ is a rational normal curve of degree $2$ in $\Pbb^2(\kfrak_\pfrak)$. The action of $\Ad(\SL(2,\kfrak_\pfrak))$ on $\Ncal$ is transitive.
      Consequently, any additive subgroup of $\sl(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$ consisting of elements satisfying $\det X = 0$ is conjugate via $\SL(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$ to a subgroup of the form $\Tbt{0}{\kfrak_\pfrak}{0}{0}$.
    \end{lemma}
    Now suppose that $\tr g \equiv 2 \mod \pfrak^{2n}$ for every $g\in \Lambda$. By inductive hypothesis, after conjugating by an element of $A^\times$ if necessary, we may assume $\Lambda \leq O^1(\pfrak^{n-1})$.
    Thus, each element $g\in \Lambda$ can be written as
    \begin{align}\label{eq:AppleWensleydale}
      g = \id +\varpi^{n-1} \gamma
    \end{align}
    for some $\gamma \in M(2, R_\pfrak)$, and the assignment $g \mapsto \gamma \mod \pfrak$ identifies $\Lambda[n] = \Lambda /\Lambda \cap O^1(\pfrak^n)$ with an additive subgroup of $\sl(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$.
    Note that since $\tr g \equiv 2 \mod \pfrak^{2n}$, one has $\tr(\gamma) \equiv 0 \mod \pfrak^{n+1}$.
    Computing determinants as in \ref{eq:AppleWensleydale},
    \begin{align*}
      1 & = \det g                                                  \\
        & = 1 + \varpi^{n-1} \tr \gamma + \varpi^{2n-2}\det \gamma,
    \end{align*}
    and since $\det g =1$, we find $\tr \gamma +\varpi^{n-1}\det \gamma =0$. From $\tr \gamma  \equiv 0 \mod \pfrak^{n+1}$ we find $ \varpi^{n-1}\det \gamma \equiv 0 \mod \pfrak^{n+1}$, so that $\det \gamma \equiv 0 \mod \pfrak^2$.
    Applying lemma \ref{lemma:killingform}, we may replace $\Lambda$ by an $O^1$-conjugate so that each $g \in \Lambda$ takes the form $g = 1 + \varpi^{n-1}\gamma$ where $\gamma = \tbt{0}{x}{0}{0} +\varpi\delta$ for some $\delta =\tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} \in M(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$. From
    \begin{align*}
      \det \gamma & = \det (\tbt{0}{x}{0}{0} +\varpi\delta)                              \\
                  & = \varpi^2 \det \delta - \varpi x c  \equiv \varpi xc \mod \pfrak^2,
    \end{align*}
    we find that $xc \equiv 0 \mod \pfrak$, so that either $x$ or $c$ is in $\pfrak$. If $x\in \pfrak$, then $g \in O^1(\pfrak^n)$ already. If this is so for all $g \in \Lambda$, then the claim is proven. Otherwise, suppose $g$ has $x \in R_\pfrak^\times$ so that $c \in \pfrak$. Then, with $\alpha_o = \Tbt{\varpi}{0}{0}{1}$, we find that $\alpha_o g \alpha_o^\inv \in O^1(\pfrak^n)$.
    To complete the proof we repeat the argument of the base case to replace $\alpha_o$ with an element $A^\times$.
  \end{proof}

Let $R$ be a commutative ring (with 	$). An algebra $(A,\iota)$ over $R$ is an associative ring $A$ with 	$ equipped with an embedding $\iota : R \to A$ of rings, mapping 	 \in R$ to 	 \in A$ such that $\iota(R)$ is contained in the center of $A$. Using $\iota$, we identify $R$ with a central subring of $A$ and suppress reference to $\iota$.
A \textbf{standard involution} on $B$ is an anti-involution $\overline{\cdot}: A \to A$ such that $x\overline{x} \in A$ for all $x\in A$. Given a standard involution on $A$, define the \textbf{reduced trace},\textbf{reduced norm}, and \textbf{characteristic polynomial} of an element of $A$ by
\begin{align*}
    \trd:         & A \to R, \quad \trd(x)    & = x + \overline{x}         \\
    \nrd:         & A \to R, \quad \nrd(x)    & = x\overline{x}            \\

In this section $R$ is an integral domain, and $k$ is its field of fractions, and $A$ a finite dimensional algebra over $k$ with unit element 	_A$. A finitely generated $R$-submodule $M$ of $A$ is a \textbf{lattice}, and is \textbf{full} if $kM=A$. A full lattice in $A$ is an \textbf{order} if it is a subring containing 	_A$.
Given a full lattice $M$ in $A$, the sets
\begin{align*}
    \Ocal_\ell(M)= \{ x \in A: xM \subset M\} \\
    \Ocal_r(M)= \{ x \in A: Mx \subset M\}
\end{align*}
are orders in $A$, and are called the \textbf{left}/\textbf{right} orders of $M$ respectively.

% \begin{rem}
% 	The reduction map $R \to R/\afrak$ induces a projection $\Ocal \to \Ocal \otimes_R R/\afrak \approx \Ocal / \afrak \Ocal$ of algebras, and in turn a projection $\pi_\afrak:\Ocal^1 \to (\Ocal \otimes_R R/\afrak)^1$ of groups. Then $\Ocal^1(\afrak) = \ker \pi_\alpha$.

% \subsection{Length spectra of arithmetic Fuchsian groups}
% Fix an arithmetic datum $(k,A,\psi,\Ocal)$ as above such that $\Ocal$ is a \emph{maximal order} in $A$, and set $\Gamma = \Gamma_{k,A,\psi,\Ocal}$. In this section, we will compute the length spectrum of the surface $X=\Gamma \lmod \Hbb$ in terms of the arithmetic of $k$.
% \subsubsection*{Geodesics as conjugacy classes}
% The quotient map $\Hbb \to \Gamma \lmod \Hbb = X$ is the universal cover, and identifies $\Gamma$ with $\pi_1(X)$. Consequently, we may identify free homotopy classes of closed curves in $X$ with conjugacy classes in $X$. As $X$ has negative curvature, there is a unique geodesic representative in each free homotopy class on $X$. Thus, we may identify the set of geodesics on $X$ with conjugacy classes in $\Gamma$. Given a conjugacy class $\gamma \subset \Gamma$, we write $\ell(\gamma)$ for the length of the corresponding geodesic.  Each $g\in \gamma$ has a unique lift $\tilde{g}$ to $\SL(2,\Rbb)$ with positive trace. We write $\tr(g)$ for $\tr(\tilde{g})$, and set
% \begin{align*}
% 	\lambda_g = \frac{t_g + \sqrt{t_g^2 - 4}}{2}.
% \end{align*}
% Then the length of the geodesic corresponding to $\gamma$ is related to $\lambda_g$ by the formula:
% \begin{align*}
% 	\lambda_g^2 = \exp(\ell(g)).
% \end{align*}
% \subsubsection*{Conjugacy classes in quaternion algebras and orders}
% In this section $F$ is a number field with number field $R$, $A$ a quaternion algebra over $F$, and $\Ocal$ a maximal order in $A$.
% The algebra $A$ is equipped with an (anti-)involution $\overline{\cdot}$ and reduced norm/trace maps:
% \begin{align*}
% 	\trd(x) & = x+\overline{x} \\
% 	\nrd(x) & = x\overline{x},
% \end{align*}
% and every element $x\in A$ satisfies its characterstic polynomial
% \begin{align*}
% 	\chi(x;T)= T^2 - \trd(x) T + \nrd (x).
% \end{align*}
% Given an element $x\in A$, let $F[x] \subset A$ be the smallest $F$-subalgebra of $A$ containing $x$.
% \begin{claim}
% 	For $x\in A$, set $\delta=\delta(x)$
% 	\begin{align*}
% 		F[x] \approx \begin{cases}
% 			             F                 & \text{ if $x\in F$}                                                     \\

% 			             F[\eps]/(\eps^2 ) & \text{if $\delta=0$ and $x\notin F$},
% 		             \end{cases}
% 	\end{align*}
% 	as $F$-algebras.
% \end{claim}
% We say $x\in A$ is semsimple in the first three cases, and regular semisimple in the second and third cases.
% \begin{claim}
% 	If $x \in A^\times$ is noncentral, then the centralizer of $x$ in $A^\times$ is $F[x]^\times$.
% \end{claim}
% We view $A$ as four dimensional affine space over $F$, and write $F[A]$ for its coordinate ring. Then $A^\times$ is the principal open subvariety of $A$ defined by the nonvanishing of $\nrd$. Its coordinate ring  $F[A^\times]$ is the localization $F[A]_{\nrd} = F[A,\nrd^{\inv}]$ of $F[A]$ away from the zero locus of $\nrd$.
% For $g \in A^\times$ and $f\in F[A]$ or $F[A^\times]$, write  $f^g$ for the function $x \mapsto  f( g x g^\inv)$. For $x\in A$, write $O(x) = \{ x^g : g \in A^\times\}\subset A$ for its orbit under conjugation by $A^\times$.
% \begin{claim}\label{orbits}
% 	For noncentral $x\in A^\times$, the orbit $O(x)$ is Zariski-closed in $A$ (and $A^times$) if and only if $x$ is not parabolic. All parabolic elements in $A^\times$ constitute a single conjugacy class, and the Zariski closure of this class is zero locus of $\delta = \trd^2-4\nrd$.
% 	% say $\Ucal$. The complement of $\Ucal$ in its Zariski closure $\overline{\Ucal}$ is the center $F^\times$ of $A^\times$. 
% \end{claim}
% \begin{claim}
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item The algebra $F[A]^{A^\times}$ of invariants in $F[A]$  under $A^\times$ is generated as an $F$ algebra by $\trd$ and $\nrd$.
% 		\item The map $(\trd,\nrd):A \to \Abb_F^2$ dual to the inclusion $F[A]^{A^\times} \to F[A]$ is a GIT quotient for the conjugation action of $A^\times$ on $A$ in the sense that its fibers are Zariski closures of conjugacy classes.
% 		\item The restriction of $(\trd,\nrd)$ to the open subset $A^{*}$ of regular semisimple elements is a genuine orbit map, in the sense that its fibers are $A^\times$ conjugacy classes in $A$.

Let $\tilde{\Lambda}$ be the \textbf{congruence closure} of $\Lambda$ in $\Gamma$. That is, $\tilde{\Lambda}$ is the smallest congruence subgroup of $\Gamma$ containing $\Lambda$. Alternatively, one has the description of $\tilde{\Lambda}$ as $\tilde{\Lambda} = \bigcap_{J \triangleleft R}\Gamma(J)\Lambda$.
\begin{claim}\label{claim:modJ}
    Let $J$ be an ideal in $R$  and $H$ a subgroup of $\Gamma$. Then the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $H\Gamma(J) = \Gamma$
        \item $H\cap \Gamma(J) = \Gamma(J)$
        \item The restriction of the natural projection $\Gamma \to \Gamma/\Gamma(J)$ to $H$ is surjective
    \end{enumerate}
    Furthermore, if $J=\prod_\pfrak \pfrak^{j_\pfrak}$ then each of these conditions holds if and only if it holds at $\pfrak^{j_\pfrak}$.
\end{claim}
\begin{claim}
    Let $J$ be an ideal in $R$ which is coprime to $I$. Then $\Lambda \Gamma(J) = \Gamma$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
    By the previous claim, it suffices to assume that $J= \pfrak^n$ is a prime power.
\end{proof}
\begin{comment}
\begin{rem}
    As $\Lambda$ and $\Gamma(I)$ are contained in $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma(I)$ is normal in $\Gamma$, the subgroup $\Gamma(I)\Lambda$ of $\Gamma$ is a congruence subgroup containing $\Lambda$.
    Consequently, $\tilde{\Lambda}\leq \Gamma(I)\Lambda$.
    Further, if we write $\Lambda(I) = \Gamma(I) \cap \Lambda$ for the kernel of the restriction to $\Lambda$ of $\pi_I$ (reduction mod $I$), then $\Gamma(I)\Lambda/\Gamma(I) \approx \Lambda / \Lambda(I)$ may be identified with a subgroup of $\SL(2,R/I)$ in such a way that the mod-$I$ reduction of trace on $\Lambda$ (as an element of $A$) coincides with the trace on $\SL(2,\R/I)$ %(as autormophisms of the free $R/I$ module $(R/I)\bigoplus (R/I)$.)
\end{rem}
\end{comment}
\begin{lemma}
    Let $\pfrak$ be a prime ideal of $R$, not dividing $2$ or $3$. Suppose $H$ is a closed subgroup of $\SL(2,R_\pfrak)$ such that $\tr(H) = R_\pfrak$. Then $H = \SL(2,R_\pfrak)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The claim will follow from the analogous statement over the residue field $\kfrak = R/\pfrak$. Indeed, if $H$ is a closed, proper subgroup of $\SL(2,R_\pfrak)$ for which $\tr(H) = R_\pfrak$, then its reduction $H(\pfrak)$ mod $\pfrak$ would be a proper subgroup of $\SL(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$ for which $\tr H(\pfrak) = \kfrak_\pfrak$.
    Suppose then that $G \leq \SL(2,\Fbb_q)$ is a subgroup for which $\tr(G) = \Fbb_q$. Let $\zeta$ be a primitive $q-1$st root of unity in $\Fbb_q$, and let $\delta$ be a primitive $q+1$st root of unity in the unique quadratic extension $\Fbb_{q^2}$ over $\Fbb_{q}$. Let $t_\zeta = \zeta+ \zeta^\inv$ and $t_\delta = \delta +\delta^\inv$
    As $\tr(G) = \Fbb_q$, there exist elements $g_\zeta$ and $g_\delta$ in $K$ such that $\tr(g_\zeta)=t_\zeta$ and $\tr(g_\delta)= t_\delta$ respectively. Note that $g_\zeta$ (resp. $g_\delta$) has order $q-1$ (resp. $q+1$), as can be seen by diagonalizing. Set $A = \langle g_\zeta\rangle$ and $K = \langle g_\delta \rangle$, and note that $A\cap K = \{1\}$.
    Let $C$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by $A$ and $K$. Then $|C|\geq (q-1)(q+1)=|A||K|$, so that $|\SL(2,\Fbb_q) : C| \leq q$. As the minimal index of a proper subgroup of $\SL(2,\Fbb_q)$ is $q+1$, we conclude that $C$, and therefore $G$, is equal to $\SL(2,\Fbb_q)$.
\end{proof}
\section{local computations}
In this section, $k$ is a nonarchimedian local field of characteristic zero, $\nu$ a normalized additive valuation, $R$ its valuation ring, $\mfrak$ the unique maximal ideal of $R$, uniformizer $\varpi \in \mfrak$, and residue field $\kfrak$ of characterstic $p$ and cardinality $q$.
\subsection*{Split case}
In this section, let $G=\SL(2,k)$. Define closed subgroups
\begin{align*}
    A & = \{ \Tbt{x}{}{}{x^\inv}: x \in k^\times \}              \\
    U & = \{ \Tbt{1}{y}{}{1}: y \in k \}                         \\
    B & = \{\Tbt{x}{y}{}{x^\inv} : x \in k^\times, y \in k\}=AU,
\end{align*}
and elements
\begin{align*}
    w      & = \Tbt{0}{-1}{1}{0} \\
    \alpha & = \Tbt{\pi}{}{}{1}
\end{align*}
of $\GL(2,k)$.
For a positive integer $n$, let $\pi_n : \SL(2,R) \to \SL(2,R/\mfrak^n)$ be the natural projection. For any subgroup $H$ of $G$, we set $H(R) = H \cap \SL(2,R)$, and $H(\mfrak^n)= \ker (\pi_n\vert_H)$.
\begin{claim}
    (a) $K=\SL(2,R)$ is a maximal compact open subgroup of $G$. (b) The subgroups $K(\mfrak^n)$ constitute neighborhood basis of the identity in $K$. (c) There are exactly two conjugacy classes of maximal compact open subgroups of $G$. Representatives for these classes are given by $K$ and $\alpha K \alpha^\inv$.
\end{claim}
\subsection*{poo}
Let $V$ be a $2$-dimensional vectorspace over $k$. Then $\End_k(V)$ is a quaternion algebra over $k$. Let $\Mcal$ denote the set of maximal orders in $\End_k(V)$.
For any lattice $L$ in $V$, the set
\begin{align*}
    \End(L) = \{x \in \End_k(V): x L \leq L\}
\end{align*}
is a maximal order in $\End_k(V)$, and every maximal order in $\End_k(V)$ takes the form $\End(L)$ for some lattice $L$ in $V$. Thus, the map $L \mapsto \End(L)$ is a surjection from the set  $\Lcal$ of lattices in $V$ to the set $\Mcal$ of maximal orders in $\End_k(V)$.
Two lattices $L,M$ satisfy $\End(L)=\End(M)$ if and only if $L=s M$ for some $s\in k^\times$. In this case, $L$ and $M$ are said to be \textbf{homothetic}, and we write $[L]$ for the homothety class of a lattice $L$.  Evidently, the map $L \mapsto \End(L)$ factors through the projection $L\mapsto [L]$ and establishes a bijection between the set $\Hcal$ of homothety classes of lattices in $V$ and the set $\Mcal$ of maximal orders in $\End_k(V)$.
There is a natural action of $\PGL(V)$ on $\Hcal$ by left muliplication, and on $\Mcal$ by conjugation. The bijection $\Hcal \to \Mcal$ described above is $\PGL(V)$ equivariant. The stabilizer of a homothety class $\Lambda$ is $\PGL(L) = R^\times \lmod \GL(L)$ where $L$ is a lattice representing $\Lambda$, and $\GL(L) = \{x \in \End_k(V): xL = L\}$, and the stabilizer of a maximal order $\Ocal$ is the image in $\PGL(V)$ of the group $\{x \in \GL(V) : x \Ocal x^\inv = \Ocal\}$.
% For a pair of homothety classes $\Lambda,\Lambda' \in \Hcal$, choose representatives $L \in \Lambda,L'\in\Lambda'$ so that $L'\leq L$. Then by the invariant factor theorem over $R$, we may pick a basis $u,v$ for $L$ such that $\pi^a u, \pi^b v $ is a basis for $L'$. The quantity $|a-b|$ is independent of the choice of representatives, and defines a distance function $d$ on $\Hcal$. 
We say that two classes $\Lambda,\Lambda' \in \Hcal$ are adjacent, and write $\Lambda\sim\Lambda'$ if there exist representative lattices $L,L'$ such that $\pi L< L'< L$ with strict containment, and we say that two maximal orders $\Ocal,\Ocal' \in \Mcal$ are adjacent, and write $\Ocal\sim \Ocal'$ if  $|\Ocal:\Ocal\cap \Ocal'| = |R:\mfrak|=q$.
\begin{proposition}
    The bijection $\Hcal \to \Mcal$ described above is a $\PGL(V)$ equivariant isomorphism of graphs.

\paragraph{Unramified local computations} In this paragraph, $k$ is a nonarchimedian local field of characteristic $0$, maximal compact subring $R$, with maximal ideal $\mfrak$ with residue field $\ffrak = R / \mfrak$ having characteristic $p$ and cardinality $q$. We fix a uniformizer $\pi \in \mfrak$.
Recall that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A quaternion algebra $\Acal$ over $k$ is a $4$-dimensional central simple $k$-algebra. Any such algebra is equipped with a canonical pair of homomorphisms $\nrd: \Acal^\times \to k^\times$ and $\trd:\Acal \to k$ called the \textbf{reduced norm} and \textbf{reduced trace}, respectively. We extend $\nrd$ to $\Acal$ by setting $\nrd(x)=0$ if $x\in \Acal \setminus \Acal^\times$. Furthermore, $\Acal$ is equipped with an anti-involution $\sigma$, which is related to $\trd$ and $\nrd$ by the formulas:
          \begin{align}
              \trd(x) = x+x^\sigma, \quad \nrd(x)=xx^\sigma.
          \end{align}
    \item An $R$-order $\Rcal$ in a quaternion algebra $\Acal$ over $k$ is a unital subring which contains $R$ and is such that $k\Rcal = \Acal$, where $k\Rcal$ is the $k$-subalgebra of $\Acal$ generated by $\Rcal$. We say $\Rcal$ is a \textbf{maximal order} if it is not properly contained in any other order.
    \item An order in a quaternion algebra is an \textbf{Eichler Order} if it is the intersection of two (not necessarily distinct) maximal orders. If $\Rcal=\Rcal_1 \cap \Rcal_2$ is an Eichler order, then $\Rcal$ is a maximal subring of both $\Rcal_1$ and $\Rcal_2$.
\end{itemize}
We define two algebras which will serve as representatives of the two isomorphism classes of quaternion algebras over $k$.
\paragraph{Split case} Let $V$ be a $2$-dimensional vectorspace over $k$. Then $\Acal=\End_k(V)$ is \textbf{the split quaternion algebra} over $k$. %If we pick a basis $e_1,e_2$ for $V$, and dual basis $e_1^*,e_2^*$ of $V^*$ and define coordinate functions $\Acal \to k$ by $a(x) = e_1^*(x e^1)$, $b(x) = e_2^*(x e^1)$, $c(x) = e_1^* (x e^2)$, $d(x) = e_2^*(x e_2)$. Relative to these coordinates,  one may identify $\Acal$ with the algebra $M(2,k)$ of $2\times 2$ matrices via the assignment $x \mapsto \tbt{a(x)}{b(x)}{c(x)}{d(x)}$.
We say a finitely generated $R$-submodule $L$ of $V$ is a(n R-)lattice (in $V$) if $kL=V$. Then $L$ is a lattice if and only if it is a compact open subgroup of $V$. For a lattice $L$, we set
\begin{align}
    \End(L)=\{x \in \End_k(V): xL\subset L\}
\end{align}
and for any other lattice $M$, we set
\begin{align}
    \Hom(L,M)=\{x \in \End_k(V): xL\subset M\}
\end{align}
and remark that these are understood \emph{as subrings of} $\End_k(V)$, not merely as abstract rings as the notation might suggest.
%\begin{def/prop}\label{def/prop:MaximalOrdersAndHomothetyClasses}
For any lattice $L$ in $V$, the subring $\End(L)$ is a maximal order in $\End_k(V)$. Coversely, any maximal order takes the form $\End(L)$ for some lattice $L$ in $V$. If $\End(L) = \End(M)$ for two lattices $L,M$, then there exists an $x\in k^\times$ such that $M=xL$. In this case, we say that $M$ and $L$ are \textbf{homothetic}. For a lattice $L$, we write $[L]= \{xL : x\in k^\times\}$ for its homothety class.
If we write $\Bcal(V) \subset V \times V$ for the set of ordered bases of $V$,  $\Lcal(V)$ for the set of lattices in $V$, and $\Hcal\Lcal(V)$ for the set of homothety classes of lattices in $V$, then there are projections:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Span_R:\Bcal(V) \to \Lcal(V)$, sending an ordered basis $(u,v)$ to the lattice $Ru+Rv$, and
    \item $[\cdot]:\Lcal(V) \to \HLcal(V)$, sending a lattice to its homothety class.
\end{itemize}
The group of units $\End_k(V)^\times$ in the quaternion algebra $\End_k(V)$ acts simply and transitively on $\Bcal(V)$. As the maps $\Bcal(V)\to \Lcal(V)$ and $\Lcal(V) \to \HLcal(V)$ are both $\GL(V)$ equivariant surjections, we find that $\Aut_k(V)$ acts transtively on these latter two.
For a lattice $L$, its stabilizer in $\Aut_k(V)$ is the group of units $\End(L)^\times$ in the maximal order $\End(L)$. Thus, we may identify $\Lcal(V)$ with \[\End_k(V)^\times / \End(M)^\times\].
In this model, the projection $M\mapsto [M]$ of a lattice to its homothety class amounts to the projection
\[\End_k(V)^\times / \End(M)^\times \to k^\times \lmod \End_k(V)^\times / \End(M)^\times\]
with $k^\times$ acting by scalars. As this action is central in $\End_k(V)$, we may write this latter quotient as  $\End_k(V)^\times / k^\times \End(M)^\times$.
% For a lattice $L \in \Lcal(V)$, the group $\GL_R(M) = \End(M)^\times$ acts simply and transitively on the fiber 
% \begin{align}
% 	\span_R^\inv(M)=\{(u,v) \in \Bcal(V): Ru+Rv=M\}.
% \end{align}
The group $k^\times$ acts transitively on the fibers of the projection $\Lcal(V) \to \HLcal(V)$ by definition, however, it does not do so freely. Rather, the subgroup $R^\times$ of $k^\times$ acts
\begin{rem}
    As $\Bcal(V)$ is a (Zariski open) subset of $V\times V \setminus {(0,0)}$ which is $k^\times$-stable, there is also a map $\Bcal(V) \to \Pbb(V\times V) \approx \Pbb^3(k)$....
\end{rem}
Now, Write $\Mcal\Ocal(V)$ for the set of maximal orders in $\End_k(V)$.  The group $\End_k(V)^\times$ acts on $\mathcal{MO}(V)$ by conjugation $\Rcal \mapsto \Rcal^g=g\Rcal g^\inv$.
\begin{prop}
    The map $L \to \End(L)$ induces an $\End_k(V)^\times$ equivariant bijection between $\HLcal(V)$ to $\MOcal(V)$.
\end{prop}
As $\End_k(V)^\times$ acts transitively on the former, it also does so on the latter $\MOcal(V)$. In other words, we have:
\begin{prop}
    Any two maximal orders in $\End_k(V)$ are conjugate.
\end{prop}
To make all of this explicit, pick basis vectors $e_1,e_2$ and identify $V$ with $k^2$. Then $\End_k(V)$ is identified with the algebra $M(2,k)$ of $2\times 2$ matrices over $k$, the lattice $L_o=Re_1+Re_2$ corresponds to $R^2 \subset k^2$, and the maximal order $\End(L_o)$ corresponds to the subring $M(2,R)$ of $M(2,k)$ with entries in $R$. We may then identify $\MOcal(V)$ with the quotient  $\GL(2,k) / k^\times \GL(2,R)$.
\end{proof}
%\item All maximal orders are conjugate by an element of $\Aut_k(V)$. 
%is an order, and is equal to $\End(L) \cap \End(M)$. In particular, it is a suborder of $\End(L)$ and $\End(M)$ and is the maximal suborder with this property. 
%It is contained in both $\End(L)$ and $\End(M)$ and is the maximal suborder of $\End(L)$ and $\End(M)$ with this property. In other words, $\Hom(L,M) = \End(L)\cap \End(M)$.
% \end{def/prop}
%Let $V$ be a $2$-dimensional vector space over $k$.  and fix basis vectors $e_1$, $e_2$ for $V$.
%We define an isomorphism $\cdot^t:V \to V^*$ extending the assignment of the basis $\{e_1,e_2\}$ to its dual basis $\{e_1^t,e_2^*\}$.

% To proceed, we need the following lemmata
% \begin{lemma}[Lemma 4.1 in \cite{leiningerLengthEigenvalueEquivalence2007}]
% 	Suppose $n \geq 1$. There is an exact sequence
% 	\begin{align*}
% 		1 \to \sl(2,R_\pfrak/\pfrak^n) \to \SL(2,R_\pfrak/ \pfrak^{2n}) \to \SL(2,R_\pfrak/\pfrak^n) \to 1
% 	\end{align*}
% 	The conjugation action of $\SL(2,R_\pfrak/\pfrak^n)$ on $\sl(2,R_\pfrak/\pfrak^n)$ induced by this sequence is the adjoint action.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
% 	The inclusion $R_\pfrak/\pfrak^n \to R_\pfrak / \pfrak^{2n}$ by $a \mapsto \varpi^n a$ induces an inclusion of $M(2, R_\pfrak/\pfrak^n) \to M(2,R_\pfrak/\pfrak^{2n})$ by $X \mapsto \varpi^n X$.
% 	Reduction modulo $\pfrak^n$ induces a surjection $\pi : \SL(2,R_\pfrak/\pfrak^{2n}) \to \SL(2,R_\pfrak/\pfrak^n)$ which has kernel
% 	\begin{equation}\label{eq:kerpi}
% 		\ker \pi = \{ \id + \varpi^n X : \det(\id + \varpi^n X)=1\}.
% 	\end{equation}
% 	Compute, for $\id + \varpi^n X \in \ker \pi$:
% 	\begin{equation*}\det(\id + \varpi^n X) = 1 + \varpi^n \tr X +\varpi^{2n} \det X =1 + \varpi^n \tr X \in R_\pfrak / \pfrak^{2n}\end{equation*}
% 	so that $\tr X = 0 \in R_\pfrak/ \pfrak^n$, which is to say $X \in \sl(2,R_\pfrak/\pfrak^n)$.
% 	Last, observe that the map $X \mapsto 1 + \varpi^n X$ is indeed a homomorphism $\sl(2,R_\pfrak/\pfrak^n) \to \SL(2,R_\pfrak / \pfrak^{2n})$: for  $X,Y \in \sl(2,R/\pfrak^n)$ compute
% 	\begin{align*}
% 		(1+\varpi^n X)(1+\varpi^n Y) = 1 + \varpi^n (X+Y) + \varpi^{2n}(XY) = 1 + \varpi^n (X+Y)
% 	\end{align*}
% 	in $\SL(2,R_\pfrak/\pfrak^{2n})$, as claimed.
% \end{proof}
\newpage
% \begin{lemma}
% 	For each $n>1$, and each prime $\pfrak$ over which $A$ is unramified, the map
% 	\begin{align}\label{eq:liealgebra}
% 		g \mapsto (g - 1)/\varpi^n
% 	\end{align}
% 	induces an isomorphism $O^1(\pfrak^n)/O^1(\pfrak^{n+1}) \approx \sl(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$. The action of $O^1$ on $O^1(\pfrak^n)/O^(\pfrak^{n+1})$ by conjugation factors through the quotient $O^1[\pfrak] \approx \SL(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$, and the isomorphism induced by \ref{eq:liealgebra} intertwines the conjugation action with the adjoint action.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{lemma}
% 	The quadratic form $X \mapsto \det x$ on $\sl(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$ is invariant under the adjoint action of $\SL(2,\kfrak_\pfrak)$. Let $\Ncal$ denote the
% \end{lemma}
% If each $g\in \Lambda$ is such that $\gamma \in \pfrak M(2,\R_\pfrak)$, then the claim is proven. Supposing otherwise. 
% To this end, we apply the following form of strong approximation:
% \begin{proposition}[Strong Approximation Theorem \cite{maclachlanArithmeticHyperbolic3Manifolds2003}]
% 	Let $A$ be a quaternion algebra over a number field $k$, and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $k$ such that $S\cap V_k^\infty \neq \emptyset$ and, for at least one $v_o \in S$, $v_o \notin \Ram(A)$. Then $A^1_k A^1_S $ is dense in $A^1_{\Abb_k}$.

\section{on cohomology}
First, on singular homology: the $q$-simplex is the topological space $\Delta^q = \{(t_0,\dots,t_q) | t_i\geq 0, \sum t_i =1 \}$.
There are \(q+1\) simplicial embeddings of \( \Delta^{q-1}$ into $\Delta^q \), given by
\[d_i : \Delta^{q-1} \to \Delta^{q},\quad d_i(t_0,\dots,t_{q-1}) =\left(t_0, \ldots, \underset{i}{0}, \ldots, t_{q-1}\right). \]
We refer to the map $d_i$ as the $i$-face of $\Delta^{q-1}$.
A $q$-simplex in a topological space $X$ is just a continuous map $\sigma: \Delta^q \to X$, and we write
\footnote{For any fixed topological space $\Delta$ the assignment $\Delta(\cdot):X \mapsto C(\Delta , X)$ is a covariant functor from the category of topological spaces to sets. Indeed, if $f:X \to Y$ is a continuous map, then the map $\Delta(f): \Delta(X) \to \Delta(Y)$ is given by post-composing a map $\sigma :\Delta \to X$ with $f:X\to Y$.
  Similarly if a target space $X$ is fixed and we vary among spaces $\Delta$ mapping into $X$ we obtain a contravariant functor, given on maps by \emph{pre-composition}.
  Slogan: maps \emph{from} a fixed space is covariant, maps \emph{to} a fixed space is contravariant.}
$\Delta^q X:=C(\Delta^q,X)$ for the set of $q$-simplices in $X$, and $C_q X :=\Zbb \Delta^q X$ for $q$-chains\footnote{The map sending a set $X$ to the free abelian group $\Zbb X$ on $X$ is covariant, so altogether, the map $X \mapsto C_q X$ sending a topological space to its (free abelian) group of $q$-cochains is covariant}
For each $i=0,..q$, the face maps $d_i$ induce natural transformations $\partial_i : \Delta^{q}(X)\to \Delta^{q-1}(X)$. We incorporate all of these maps together via the \textbf{singular boundary map} on $q$-chains, via the formula
\[\partial=\sum^q(-1)^i \partial_i: C_q X \rightarrow C_{q-1} X.\]
A key fact is that the composite maps $\partial \circ \partial C^{q}X\to C^{q-2}X $ are identically zero for each $q$. Symbolically: $B_qX \leq Z_q X \leq C_q$. In words: the $q$ boundary of any $q+1$ chain is a $q$-cycle; slightly less precisely: the boundary of a boundary is empty.
Chains in  $Z_qX=\operatorname{ker} \partial: C_q X \rightarrow C_{q-1} X$ are called $q$-cycles in $X$, and those in $B_q X=\operatorname{img} \partial: C_{q+1} X \rightarrow C_q X^{\bullet}$ are $q$-boundaries. The quotient $H_q X = Z_q X/B_q X$ is the $q$-th homology group of $X$.
\begin{remark}
  A $0$-chain in $X$ is just a formal $\Zbb$-linear combination of points. Every $0$-chain is a $0$-cycle, as $\partial:C_0(X) \to C_{-1}X=0$ is the zero map.
\end{remark}
Associated to a connected space $X$ is the \textbf{augmentation map}, as follows. Recalling that $C_0X = \Zbb X$ is simply the free abelian group generated by $X$, there is an adjunction: $\hom_{gp}(\Zbb X,A) = \hom_{set}(X,A)$ for any abelian group $A$. Taking $A = \Zbb$, we define a map $\eps_X : C_0 X \to \Zbb$ as the unique $\Zbb$-linear extension of the map $X\to \Zbb$ sending every element to $1\in \Zbb$.
\begin{lemma}
  The augmentation map induces an identification of $H_0X$ with the free abelian group $\Zbb \pi_0(X)$ on the path components of $X$.
\end{lemma}
\subsection*{$\pi_1$}
Recall that each point $v$ in the $q$-dimensional simplex $\Delta^q$ admits a unique expression $v = \sum_{i=0}^q t_i e_i$ subject to the condition $\sum t_i = 1$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Delta^0 = \{e_0\} \subset \Rbb^1$ is a point, a $0$-simplex $\sigma: \Delta^0 \to X$ amounts to a choice of image $x=x_\sigma=\sigma(e_0) \in X$.
  \item $\Delta^1 = \{ t_0 e_0+t_1 e_1 \in \Rbb^2: t_0 + t_1 = 1\}$ is a line segment. The two face maps $\Delta^0 \to \Delta^1$ are the \emph{target} map \[t=d_0: e_0 \mapsto 0e_0+1e_1\] and the \emph{source} map \[s=d_1: e_0 \mapsto 1 e_0 +0 e_1.\] The boundary of the defining inclusion $\iota:\Delta^1 \to \Rbb^2$ is the formal difference (target) minus (source) $\partial \iota =t-s $.
  \item The three face maps $\Delta^1 \to \Delta^2$ are:
        \begin{align*}
          d^0 & : \tau e_0 + (1-\tau) e_1 \to 0 e_0 + (1-\tau) e_1 + \tau e_2 \\
          d^1 & : \tau e_0 + (1-\tau) e_1 \to \tau e_0 + 0 e_1 + (1-\tau)e_2  \\
          d^2 & : \tau e_0 + (1-\tau) e_1 \to \tau e_0 + (1-\tau) e_1 + 0e_2
        \end{align*}
        and the boundary of the inclusion $\Delta^2 \to \Rbb^3$ is the formal difference $d^0-d^1+d^2$.
  \item A path in $X$ is a continuous map of the interval $[0,1]$ to $X$. Two paths $\gamma,\gamma'$ are composable if $\gamma(1)=\gamma'(0)$ in which case we write $\gamma*\gamma'$ for the path
        \begin{align*}
          t \mapsto
          \begin{cases}
            \gamma(2t)    & \text{if }t\leq 1/2  \\ %if $t\leq 1/2$ \\
            \gamma'(2t-1) & \text{if }t \geq 1/2 %if $t\geq 1/2$
          \end{cases}
        \end{align*}
        and for any path $\gamma$ write $\gamma^\inv$ for the path $t \mapsto \gamma(1-t)$.
  \item Suppose we are given a pointed space $(X,x_o)$. Given a homotopy class $\alpha \in \pi_1(X,x_o)$, pick a pointed loop $\gamma : S^1 \to X$  representing $\alpha$ and such that $\gamma(1)=x_0$.
  \item Write $e: \Delta^1 \to \Delta^1/\partial \Delta^1$ for the quotient map, and identify the latter with $S^1$. Then we can pullback $\gamma$ along $e$ to obtain a $1$-chain $\gamma \circ e : \Delta^1 \to X$. As $\gamma$ is a closed loop, the $1$-chain $\gamma \circ e$ is a 1-cycle.
  \item Suppose $\gamma'$ is another representative pointed loop for $\alpha$. I claim that $\gamma'\circ e$ and $\gamma \circ e$ are then homologous cycles.
  \item Indeed, let $H: \Delta^1 \times \Delta^1 \to X$ be a pointed homotopy between $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$, so that $H(0,\cdot)=\gamma \circ e$, $H(1,\cdot )= \gamma'\circ e$ and $H(t,0)=H(t,1) = x_o$ for all $t\in \Delta^1$ and set $w(t)=H(t,t)$.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{rescores}
Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of a group $G$, and let $A$ be a $G$-module. Then $G$ preserves the submodule $A^N$ of $N$-fixed points, and the action of $G$ on $A^N$ factors through $G/N$.
The inflation-restriction exact sequence is:
\begin{align*}
  H^1\left(G / N, A^N\right) \xhookrightarrow{{\rm infl}} H^1(G, A)\xrightarrow{{\rm res}} H^1(N, A)^{G / N} \xrightarrow{{\rm tran}} H^2\left(G / N, A^N\right) \xrightarrow{{\rm infl}} H^2(G, A)
\end{align*}
More generally, if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then there is a restriction map $C^q(G,A)\to C^q(H,A)$ at the level of chains.
\section{cohomology}
For any space $X$, there is a canonical diagonal map $\Delta: X\hookrightarrow X\times X$. This induces a map $H_*(X;R) \to H_*(X\times X;R)$ for any abelian group $R$. If moreover $R$ is a ring, then there is a map (cross product)
\begin{align*}
  \times : H_*(X;R)\otimes_R H_*(X;R) \to H_*(X\times X;R).
\end{align*}
Somehow $R$-being a PID+Kunneth's formula tells us that this map is a monomorphism, and ``if the remaining term of the kunneth sequence is zero'' then this map is an isomorphism.
When $R$ is a field, this map is universally defined and natural in $X$.
\subsection{}
Let $A$ be an abelian group. A singular $q$-cochain with values in $N$ is a(ny) function $\Sing_q X\to N$.
If $N$ is an $R$-module, a singular $q$-cochain with values in $N$ admits a unique extension $S_q(X;R)\to N$ which is $R$-linear.
In this case, we set
\begin{align*}
  S^n(X ; N)=\operatorname{Map}\left(\operatorname{Sin}_n(X), N\right)=\operatorname{Hom}_R\left(S_n(X ; R), N\right)
\end{align*}
which is naturally an $R$-module.
The boundary map
\begin{align*}
  d: S_{n+1}(X ; R) \rightarrow S_n(X ; R)
\end{align*}
induces the \emph{coboundary} map
\begin{align*}
  d: S^n(X ; N) \rightarrow S^{n+1}(X ; N)
\end{align*}
via the rule
\begin{align*}
  (d f)(\sigma)=(-1)^{n+1} f(d \sigma)
\end{align*}
and we define the $n$th singular cohomology groups with coefficients in $N$ as
\begin{align*}
  H^n(X ; N)=\frac{\operatorname{ker}\left(S^n(X ; N) \rightarrow S^{n+1}(X ; N)\right)}{\operatorname{im}\left(S^{n-1}(X ; N) \rightarrow S^n(X ; N)\right)}.
\end{align*}
If $N$ is an $R$-module then so too is $H^n(X;N)$ .
\section{$H^0$}
A $0$-cochain is a(ny) function $\Sing_0 X \to N$. Identifying $\Sing_0 X \to N$, see that a $0$-cochain is just a function $f:X\to N$.
If $\sigma: \Delta`^1 \to X$ is a $1$ simplex, then
\begin{align*}
  \left(d f\right)(\sigma) & = -f \left(\sigma(e_0) - \sigma(e_1)\right) \\
                           & = f(\sigma(e_1)) - f(\sigma(e_0))
\end{align*}

  \item If $G$ is an open subgroup of $\Gamma_1(\mfrak)$, is $G$ uniformly pro-p?

\paragraph*{2023-05-03 11:49:15}
For now $k=\Qbb$, and $S_0$ is a finite set of rational primes.
$\Gbf\leq \GL_r$ is a connected simply-connected, simple LAG over $\Qbb$, and $\Gamma = \Gbf(\Zbb_S)$ (so that, in fact, $\Gbf \leq \SL_r$.). Write $d$ for the dimension of $\Gbf$.
Write $\Gbf(\Zbb/m\Zbb)$ for the image in $\GL_r(\Zbb/m\Zbb)$ of $\Gbf(\Zbb_S)$ (so long as $m$ is coprime to $S$).
\begin{proposition}
  Let $H$ be a congruence subgroup of $\Gamma$. Then there exists an $m \in \Zbb$ and a constant $c=c(\Gbf)$ such that $\Gamma(m)\leq H$ where $m \leq c \cdot |\Gamma:H|$.
  Paraphrase: the level of a congruence subgroup is bounded by (a constant times) its index.

\section{relations among congruence subgroups}
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$, let $M(R)$ be the associative algebra of $2\times 2$ matrices with coefficients in $R$, and define functions $a,b,c,d$ on $M(R)$ so that
\begin{align*}
  g = \Tbt{a_g}{b_g}{c_g}{d_g}
\end{align*}
Define multiplicative subgroups of $M(R)$ by
\begin{align*}\label{groups}
  \mathbf{G}(R) & =\{g:a_g,b_g,c_g,d_g \in R, a_gd_g-b_gc_g=1 \} \\
  \mathbf{A}(R) & =\{g \in \mathbf{G}(R) : b_g=c_g = 0\}         \\
  \mathbf{B}(R) & =\{g\in \mathbf{G}(R) : c_g = 0\}              \\
  \mathbf{U}(R) & =\{g \in \mathbf{G}(R) : a_g-1=d_g-1=c_g = 0\}
\end{align*}
\begin{lemma}
  Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The functions $a$ and $d$ restrict to $\mathbf{A}(R)$ to give isomorphisms $A(R) \approx R^\times$. Write $\alpha,\delta: R^\times \to \mathbf{G}(R)$ for their respective inverses
    \item The function $b$ restricts to $\mathbf{U}(R)$ to give an isomorphism $\mathbf{U}(R) \to R$. Write $\beta  R \to \mathbf{G}(R)$ for the inverse to $b$.
    \item $\mathbf{A}(R)$ normalizes $\mathbf{U}(R)$; if $t\in \mathbf{A}(R)$ and $u \in \mathbf{U}(R)$, then $b_{tut^\inv} = a_t/d_t \cdot b_u = a_t^2 b_u$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
Fix a nonarchimedian local field $k$ of characteristic $0$, with residue field $\ffrak$ of cardinality $q= p^f$ where $p$ is an odd prime. Let $R$ denote the ring of integers in $R$ and $\pfrak$ its unique maximal ideal, and choose a uniformizer $\varpi$ for $\pfrak$. Denote by $\pi_n : R \to R/\pfrak^n$ the reduction map.
For any of the groupschemes $\Hbf$ defined above, we let $H$ denote $H(R)$, set $H(n):=\Hbf(R/\pfrak^n)$, and set $H[n]:= \ker \left( H \to H[n]\right)$. Thus, for each $n$, there is an exact sequence
\begin{align}
  1 \to H[n]\to H \to H(n) \to 1
\end{align}
induced by applying $\Hbf$ to the morphism $\pi_m : R \to R/\pfrak^n$.
\section*{computations}
For $g,h \in \GL_2(k)$ and $x \in M_2(k)$, we write $\Ad(g)x=gxg^\inv$ and $[g,h]=ghg^\inv h^\inv$.
For $n \in \Nbb$, set
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{B}_(n)=\left\{x \in \mathrm{SL}_2\left(R\right) \mid x \equiv \operatorname{Id} \quad\left(\bmod \pfrak^n\right)\right\}

For $a,b,c \in k$, with $c\neq -1$,  define elements

                                                                          0   & \frac{1}{1+c}
                                                                        \end{array}\right), w=\left(\begin{array}{rr}

\end{align*}
of $\SL_2(k)$ These matrices satisfy the relations:
\begin{align*}
  \Ad(D_c)R_b & =R_{b(1+c)^2}                            \\
  \Ad(D_c)L_a & =L_{a(1+c)^{-2}}                         \\
  \Ad(w)R_b   & = L_{-b}                                 \\
  \Ad(w)L_a   & = R_{-a}                                 \\
  D_c         & = L_{-(c-1)^\inv}R_{c-1}w R_{(c-1)^\inv}
\end{align*}
\begin{lemma}[lemma 3.3 in \cite{morraExplicitDescriptionIrreducible2011}]
  For $n\geq 1$, one has
  \begin{align*}
    B(n)=\langle L_x,R_y,D_z : x,y,z \in \pfrak^n \rangle
  \end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $g = \tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} \in B(n)$. As $a \in 1+\pfrak^n$, the element $x = -c/a$ satisfies $\nu(x)=\nu(c)\geq n$, and
  \begin{align*}
    L_x g = \Tbt{a}{b}{0}{xb+d}.
  \end{align*}
  Likewise, setting $y = -b/a \in \pfrak^n$ we have
  \begin{align*}
    L_x g R_y = \Tbt{a}{}{}{d+b*x}.
  \end{align*}
  Observe that $d+b*x = d -cb/a = (ad-bc)/a =1/a$ as $\det g =1$. Thus, with $z = a-1 \in \pfrak^n$ we have
  \begin{align*}
    g = L_{c/a}D_{a-1}R_{b/a}
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
For a real number $x$, the generalized binomial coefficient is
\begin{align*}
  {x \choose k} =\frac{1}{k !} \prod_{i=0}^{k-1}\left(x-i\right).
\end{align*}
\begin{lemma}
  The sequence of functions $psi_n(x):=\sum_{k=0}^n{1/2 \choose k} x^k$ converges on $\pfrak$ to a function $\psi$ sastifying:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\psi(x)^2 = 1+x$,
    \item $\psi(x) \equiv 1 \mod \pfrak$,
    \item $\nu(\psi(x)-1)=\nu(x)$,
  \end{enumerate}
  for all $x\in \pfrak$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}
  For $n\geq 1$, we have $B(2n)\leq [B(n),B(n)]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  It suffices to show that $R_b,L_a,D_c\in [B(n),B(n)]$ for all $a,b,c\in \pfrak^{2n}$. Write $b = \pi^{n}b'$ with $b' \in \pfrak^n$. Then $\psi(b')^2=1+b'$  and $\psi(b')\equiv 1 \mod \pfrak^n$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    [\Tbt{\psi(b')}{}{}{1/\psi(b')},\Tbt{1}{\pi^n}{0}{1}] = \Tbt{1}{\pi^n(\psi(b')^2-1)}{0}{1} =\Tbt{1}{b}{0}{1},
  \end{align*}
  so that $R_b \in [B(n),B(n)]$. The same argument shows that $L_b \in [B(n),B(n)]$.
  Now suppose $c\in \pfrak^{2n}$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    [\Tbt{\psi(c)}{0}{-c/\pi^n\psi(c)}{-1/\psi(c)}, \Tbt{1}{\pi^n}{c/\pi^n}{c+1}] = D_c,
  \end{align*}
  and since $\psi(c)=1 \mod \pi^n$, these matrices are in $B(n)$, showing $D_c \in [B(n),B(n)] $ as desired.
\end{proof}

Let $L_i = \pfrak^i \sl_2(R)$ with bracket $[x,y]=xy-yx$ and $L_k^i = L_i/L_k$.
We denote the reduction map $R \to R/\pfrak^j$ by $\rho_j$, and use the same symbol to denote the coordinatwise reduction map on matrices.
Write $\omega:\ffrak^\times \to R^\times$ for the Teichmuller character, which we extend to $0\in \ffrak$ by $\omega(0)=0 \in R$. Set $\Omega=\omega(\ffrak) \subset R$.
Each $A$ in $L_i$ has a unique expansion $A = \sum_j \pi^j A_j$, where each $A_j$ has entries lying in $\Omega$, and $A_j = \bm{0}_2$ for $j< i$. Set $\nu(A) = \inf\{j| A_j \neq \bm{0}_2\}$, and write $\bar{A}=A_{\nu(A)}$ for the leading term of $A$. Note that $\bar{A}$ has entries in $\Omega$, and that $\omega^\inv(\bar{A})=\rho_1(\bar{A})$.
In $L_k^i$, if $\nu(A) \geq k$, then $A=\bm{0}_2$, and if $A\neq 0$ in $L_k^i$ then its order is $q^{k-\nu(A)}$, and $\bar{A} = \bar{\pi^j A}$ for $j < k - \nu(A)$.
As an additive group, $L_k^i$ is isomorphic to $(R/\pfrak^{k-i})^3$.
\begin{lemma}
    Let $B=\tbt{b_1}{b_2}{b_3}{-b_1}$, $C=\tbt{c_1}{c_2}{c_3}{-c_1}$  be  nonzero elements of $\sl_2(\ffrak)$  Then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The image of $\ad C: \sl_2(\ffrak) \to \sl_2(\ffrak)$ consists of those  $X=\tbt{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}{x_1}$ with $2c_1 x_1 + c_3x_2 + c_2x_3 =0$. Consequently, there exists an $X$ such that $[C,X]=C$ if and only if $2c_1^2 +2c_3c_2=-2\det C =0$.
        \item If $\det C =0$ then $\ad C$ is nilpotent and $\dim \im \ad C =2$.
        \item Suppose that $\det C =0$. Then $C$ is an eigenvector of $\ad B$ if and only if $B \in \im \ad C$ if and only if $2c_1b_1+c_3b_2+c_2b_3 =0$. In this case, the eigenvalue is nonzero if $\{B,C\}$ are linearly independent. In this case, $\{B,C\}$ span the image of $\ad C$.
        \item If $\det C \neq 0$, then $\ad C$ is diagonalizable (over an algebraic closure of $\ffrak$), with eigenvalues $0$ and $\pm 2 \sqrt{- \det C}$. In this case, if $\ad C$ is an eigenvector for $\ad B$, then $B=aC$ for some $a\in \ffrak$, and the corresponding eigenvalue is $0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
We conclude: Let $L$ be the plane in $\sl_2(\ffrak)$ consisting of those $X=\tbt{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}{x_1}$ cut out by the equation $2c_1 x_1 + c_3x_2 + c_2x_3 =0$. Then
\begin{enumerate}
    \item if $C \in L$, then the set $\{A,B,[A,B]\}$ is linearly independent for any distinct $A,B \in L$
    \item If $C\not\in L$ and $\{A,B\}$ is linearly independent with $A,B \in L$, then $\{A,B,[A,B]\}$ spans $\sl_2(\ffrak)$.
\end{enumerate}
With respect to the basis $\{h,x,y\}$ the action of $\ad C$ is given by
\begin{align*}
    \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
              0      & c_3    & -c_2  \\
              2 c_2  & -2 c_1 & 0     \\
              -2 c_3 & 0      & 2 c_1
          \end{array}\right)
\end{align*}Let $\Zbb_\lambda = \Zbb/p^\lambda\Zbb$, and for $k\leq \lambda$  set $G= \Zbb_\lambda \times \Zbb_{\lambda-k}$.
Pick integers $\sigma \in \Zbb\setminus p\Zbb$ and $\Delta = p^k \Delta'$ with $\Delta'$ coprime to $p$. Define a bilinear function $G\times G \to \mu[p^\lambda]$ by $\ip{u}{v} = \exp( 2\pi i \sigma \frac{2 u_1 v_1 + \Delta u_2 v_2}{p^\lambda})$ for $u=(u_1,u_2)$ and $v=(v_1,v_2)$.
Then $G$ evidently is self dual with respect to this form.
For each $\alpha \in \Zbb$, let $m_\alpha : (u_1,u_2)\mapsto (\alpha u_1,\alpha u_2)$, which is an endormorphism of $G$.
Let $H= L^2(G)$, a finite dimensional hilbert space. Define for $\alpha \in \Zbb_\lambda^\times$ and $\beta \in \Zbb_\lambda$, operators on $H$:
\begin{align}
    A(\alpha)\phi(u) & = \chi_p(u\alpha)^k\phi(u\alpha)                                                  \\
    B(\beta)\phi(u)  & =\exp( 2\pi i \beta  \frac{u_1^2 + \Delta u_2^2}{p^\lambda})\phi(u)               \\
    W\phi(u)         & = c \sum_{t\in G}\phi(v)\exp(-4\pi \sigma\frac{u_1v_1+\Delta u_2 v_2}{p^\lambda})
\end{align}
where $c =p^{-\lambda+k/2}\chi_p(\Delta')^{\lambda - k}\chi_p(\sigma)^k\eps$.
Define elements $d_\alpha = \tbt{\alpha}{}{}{\alpha^\inv}$ and $\zeta_\beta = \tbt{1}{\beta}{}{1}$ for $\alpha,\beta$ as above, and set $w = \tbt{}{-1}{1}{}$.
\begin{lemma}
    If $g=\tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} \in \SL(2,\Zbb_\lambda)$ satisfies $c\neq 0$ mod $p$ then
    \[g =\zeta_{a/c}w d_{c} \zeta_{dc}\]
    and if $c= 0$ mod $p$ then  $a \in \Zbb_\lambda^\times$ and
    \[g = w \zeta_{-c/a}wd_{-a}\zeta_{b/a}\].
\end{lemma}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $G$ is a compact subgroup of $\SL(2,k)$.
    \item $\Lcal$ is the set of lattices in $k^2$
    \item Say $L,L' \in \Lcal$ are homothetic, written $L \sim L'$, if there exists a $\lambda \in k^\times$ so that $L = \lambda L'$. For a lattice $L$ write $[L]$ for its homothety class.  Write $\Xcal$ for the set of homothety classes of lattices in $k^2$.
    \item Fix a lattice $L \in k^2$. Then for any class $x \in \Xcal$, there is a unique lattice $L_x$ maximal in its homothety class subject to the requirement $L_x \leq L$.
    \item If $u,v \in k^2$ are linearly indepedent, then $\langle u,v \rangle$ is the lattice $Ru+Rv$ they span. We write $[u,v]$ for $[\langle u,v \rangle]$ for the homothety class of the lattice they span.
    \item If $L$ is a lattice, and $L'$ is a sublattice, then there exists a basis $u,v$ for $k^2$ and a unique pair $m,n$ of nonnegative integers such that $L=\langle u, v \rangle$ and $L' = \langle \pi^m u, \pi^{m+n} \rangle$. In this case, the distance between the homothety classes $[L],[L']$ is $n$ and if $x = [L'] \in \Xcal$ then $L_x = \pi^{-m}L'$.
    \item For a lattice $L$ and a positive integer $m$, set $L[m]= L/\pi^m L$ and let $\rho_{L,m}: \Aut_R(L) \to \Aut_{R/\pi^m}(L[m])$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{lemma}
    Suppose $g\in \SL(2,k)$ and $L \in \Lcal$ is a lattice such that $gL\leq L$. Then $gL=L$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\mu$ be a haar measure on $k^2$. Then for any $g \in \GL(2,k)$, and any subset $A$  of $k^2$, one has $\mu (gA) =|\det (g)|^\inv \mu(A)$. Thus, if $g \in \SL_2(k)$ and $L$ is a lattice in $k^2$ such that $gL\leq L$, one has $|L:gL|=\mu(L)/\mu(gL) = 1$, as claimed.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    If $g \in \SL(2,k)$ and $x\in \Xcal$ satisfies $gx=x$, then for any lattice $L \in x$ one has $gL=L$.
\end{corollary}
Suppose $g \in \SL(2,k)$  and $x,y \in \Xcal$ satisfy $gx=x$ and $gy=y$ and $d(x,y)=m$. Pick a lattice $L \in x$ and let $L_y$ be the representative of $y$ as above. Then we have a short exact sequence of free modules over $R/\pi^m$:
\begin{align*}
    0 \to L_y/\pi^mL \to L/\pi^m L \to L/L_y \to 0
\end{align*}
where $L_y/\pi^mL$ and $ L/L_y$ are rank $1$ and $L/\pi^m L$ is rank $2$. Since $gL=L$ and $gL_y=L_y$, the action of $g$ on $L/\pi^m L$ induces actions on $L_y/\pi^m L$ and $L/L_y$. Thus, there are elements $\chi_{L_y/\pi^m L}(g) \in (R/\pi^m)^\times = \Aut(L_y/\pi^m L)$ and $\chi_{L/L_y}(g) \in (R/\pi^m)^\times = \Aut(L/L_y)$. It follows that the characteristic polynonmial of $\rho_{L[m]}(g) \in R/p^m [T]$ factors as:
\begin{align*}
    \det(T\cdot \id-\rho_{L[m]}(g)) =\left(T-\chi_{L_y/\pi^m L}(g)\right)\left(T-\chi_{L/L_y}(g)\right) \quad \text{ in $R/\pi^m [T]$}
\end{align*}
Then there is a basis $u,v$ of $L$ such that $L_y= \langle u , \pi^n v \rangle$,

We regard $k^2$ as a space of column vectors, with distinguished basis vectors $e_1,e_2$. We write $L_0 = Re_1+Re_2$ and refer to this as the \textbf{distinguished lattice}, and refer to its homothety class $\Lambda_0 = [L_0]$ as the \textbf{distingushed vertex} of $\Tcal$. We let $L_1 = Re_1 + \pfrak e_2$, and set $\Lambda_1 = [L_1]$ and refer to $C=(\Lambda_0,\Lambda_1)$ as the \textbf{distinguished edge} of $\Tcal$.
$G=\GL(2,k)$ acts on the set of lattices in $k^2$: for $g\in \GL(2,k)$ and a lattice $L$, the set $gL = \{ g v : v \in L\}$ is also a lattice in $k^2$. This action is transitive: given a lattice $L$, pick an $R$ basis $(v,w)$ for $L$ and define $g_L$ by the assignment $ge_1 = v$ and $ge_2 = w$. Then $g_L L_0 =L$, where $L_0$ is our distinguished lattice $R^2$ in $k^2$ as above. Under this action, the stabilizer of $L_0$ is $K:=\GL(2,R)$. \footnote{If $L= gL_0$ is any other lattice, then its stabilizer in $\GL(2,k)$ is $\Aut_R(L)=g \GL(2,R)g^\inv$}. Thus, the orbit map $g \mapsto gL_0$ induces a bijection $G/K$ with the set of lattices in $k^2$.

As this action of $k^\times$ on $\GL(2,k)$ is central, this quotient can be identified with $G/k^\times K$, or with $\PGL(2,k)/\PGL(2,R)$ \footnote{We remark that the action of $\GL(2,k)$ on $\Tcal$ factors through an effective action by $\PGL(2,k)$ which is transitive both on vertices and ordered edges.}

The function $g \mapsto \ord(\det g) \mod 2 $ is a homomorphism $\GL(2,F) \to \Zbb/2\Zbb$ which factors through $\PGL(2,F)$. We say $g\in \GL(2,F)$ or its image in $\PGL(2,F)$ is even or odd accordingly.

An element $\overline{g} \in \PGL(2,F)$ interchanges these two orbits if and only if any lift $g \in \GL(2,F)$ has $\ord(\det(g))$ odd.

Let $H$ be a group, and $\rho: H \to \GL(2,k)$ be a representation. Then $H$ acts (through $\rho$) on $\Tcal$, and the set of fixed points $\Tcal(\rho)$ is a (possibly empty) connected subtree of $\Tcal$. First, observe the following:

For each finite place $\pfrak$ of $k$ over which $A$ is split, pick an isomorphism of $A_\pfrak =A\otimes_k k_\pfrak$ with $M(2,k_\pfrak)$ such that $\Ocal_\pfrak = \Ocal \otimes_R R_\pfrak$ maps to $M(2,R_\pfrak)$ and write $\rho_\pfrak:A^\times \to \GL(2,k_\pfrak)$ for the composition of the natural embedding $A^\times \to (A\otimes_k k_\pfrak)^\times$ followed by our chosen isomorphism $A_\pfrak^\times \approx \GL(2,k_\pfrak)$.

\begin{definition}[Bruhat-Tits tree]
    The Bruhat-Tits tree $\Tcal$ for $\GL(2,k)$ is the following graph: the vertices of $\Tcal$ are homothety classes of $R$-lattices in $k^2$.
    If $L$ is a lattice in $k^2$, we write $[L]$ for its homothety class.
    Two vertices $\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2 $ of $\Tcal$ are adjacent if there are representative lattices $L_i \in \Lambda_i$ such that $\pi L_1 < L_2 < L_1$ with each inclusion proper.
    We write $V(\Tcal)$ for the vertices of $\Tcal$, and $E(\Tcal)$ for the edges of $\Tcal$ (which consist of ordered pairs of adjacent vertices.)
\end{definition}
We regard $k^2$ as a space of column vectors, with distinguished basis vectors $e_1,e_2$. We write $L_0 = Re_1+Re_2$ and refer to this as the \textbf{distinguished lattice}, and refer to its homothety class $\Lambda_0 = [L_0]$ as the \textbf{distingushed vertex} of $\Tcal$. We let $L_1 = Re_1 + \pfrak e_2$, and set $\Lambda_1 = [L_1]$ and refer to $C=(\Lambda_0,\Lambda_1)$ as the \textbf{distinguished edge} of $\Tcal$.
$G=\GL(2,k)$ acts on the set of lattices in $k^2$: for $g\in \GL(2,k)$ and a lattice $L$, the set $gL = \{ g v : v \in L\}$ is also a lattice in $k^2$. This action is transitive: given a lattice $L$, pick an $R$ basis $(v,w)$ for $L$ and define $g_L$ by the assignment $ge_1 = v$ and $ge_2 = w$. Then $g_L L_0 =L$, where $L_0$ is our distinguished lattice $R^2$ in $k^2$ as above. Under this action, the stabilizer of $L_0$ is $K:=\GL(2,R)$. \footnote{If $L= gL_0$ is any other lattice, then its stabilizer in $\GL(2,k)$ is $\Aut_R(L)=g \GL(2,R)g^\inv$}. Thus, the orbit map $g \mapsto gL_0$ induces a bijection $G/K$ with the set of lattices in $k^2$.
Under this bijection, the map $L\mapsto [L]$ sending a lattice to its homothety class, corresponds to the quotient $G / K \to k^\times \lmod G \rmod K$ with $k^\times$ acting by scaling. Thus, we have an identification of
\begin{align*}
    V(\Tcal) \approx k^\times \lmod G/K.
\end{align*}
As this action of $k^\times$ on $\GL(2,k)$ is central, this quotient can be identified with $G/k^\times K$, or with $\PGL(2,k)/\PGL(2,R)$ \footnote{We remark that the action of $\GL(2,k)$ on $\Tcal$ factors through an effective action by $\PGL(2,k)$ which is transitive both on vertices and ordered edges.}
The stabilizer in $\GL(2,k)$ of the distinguished vertex $\Lambda_0$ is $k^\times \cdot K$, and the stabilizer of the distinguished (oriented) edge $C = (\Lambda_0,\Lambda_1)$ is $k^\times K_0(\pfrak)$ where $K_0(\pfrak)=K\cap \tbt{1}{0}{0}{\pi}K\tbt{1}{0}{0}{\pi}^\inv$ consists of those $\tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} \in \GL(2,R)$  with $c \in \pfrak$.
The element $\tbt{0}{\pi}{-1}{0}$ of $\GL(2,k)$ induces an involution on $\Tcal$ which fixes no vertex, but interchanges the vertices $\Lambda_0$ and $\Lambda_1$ of the distinguished edge $C$. In particular,

Setup from \cite{chinburgEmbeddingTheoremQuaternion1999}. If $D$ is a maximal order in $M(2,F)$, then there exists a $g\in \PGL(2,F)$ such that $g D g^\inv = M(2,R)$. If $D'$ is any other maximal order, we may pick among such $g$ one for which $gD'g^\inv = \Tbt{R}{\pfrak^n}{\pfrak^{-n}}{R}$ for a nonnegative integer $n:=d(D,D')$. Alternatively, $d(D,D')$ may be characterized as the the positive integer $n$ such that $D/(D\cap D') \approx R/\pfrak^n$ as $R$ modules. We write $\Tcal$ for the tree whose vertices are maximal orders in $M(2,F)$, and two orders $D,D'$ are adjacent, written $D \sim D'$ if $d(D,D')=1$.
The function $g \mapsto \ord(\det g) \mod 2 $ is a homomorphism $\GL(2,F) \to \Zbb/2\Zbb$ which factors through $\PGL(2,F)$. We say $g\in \GL(2,F)$ or its image in $\PGL(2,F)$ is even or odd accordingly.
\begin{proposition}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\PGL(2,F)$ acts on $\Tcal$ (by conjugation $D\mapsto gDg^\inv$) transitively on both vertices and edges.

An element $\overline{g} \in \PGL(2,F)$ interchanges these two orbits if and only if any lift $g \in \GL(2,F)$ has $\ord(\det(g))$ odd.
        \item Any maximal compact subgroup of $\PGL(2,F)$ is the stabilizer of an edge or a vertex.

    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
The discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of an element $g\in \GL(2,F)$ is $\disc(g) =(\tr g)^2 - 4 \det g$. The function $g \mapsto \disc(g)/\det(g)$ is invariant under the center, and thus descends to a function on the quotient $\PGL(2,F)$, which we will call by the same name.
\begin{proposition}
    For an element $g\in \GL(2,F)$, with image $\overline{g}$ in $\PGL(2,F)$, the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\overline{g}$ fixes an edge or a vertex of $\Tcal$.
        \item $\disc(g)/\det(g) \in R$
        \item $\overline{g}$ lies in a compact subgroup of $\PGL(2,F)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    In this case, $\overline{g}$ fixes an edge in $\Tcal$ if and only if at least one of the following conditions is true:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $g \in F^\times$
        \item $\ord \det (g)$ is odd
        \item the subalgebra $F[g]$ of $M(2,F)$ is not a field
        \item $\disc(g)/\det(g) \in \pfrak$.
    \end{enumerate}
    If all of these conditions fail, then $g$ fixes exactly one vertex and no edges.
\end{proposition}
\paragraph*{Subsets of $\Tcal$.}
\paragraph*{Invariant subtrees}
Let $H$ be a group, and $\rho: H \to \GL(2,k)$ be a representation. Then $H$ acts (through $\rho$) on $\Tcal$, and the set of fixed points $\Tcal(\rho)$ is a (possibly empty) connected subtree of $\Tcal$. First, observe the following:
\begin{proposition}
    The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Tcal(\rho)$ is nonempty.
        \item the image of $\rho(H)$ in $\PGL(2,k)$ is relatively compact
        \item the image of $\rho(H)$ in $\PGL(2,k)$ is bounded
        \item for all $g\in H$,  $\frac{(\tr\rho(g))^2}{\det \rho (g)}-4 \in R$
              \ite m there is an equivalent representation $\rho': H \to \GL(2,k)$ such that $\rho'(H)$ is contained in $k^\times\cdot \GL(2,R)$ or the normalizer of $K_0(\pfrak)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
A theorem of \cite{bellaicheSousgroupesGLArbres2014} demonstrates that $\Tcal(\rho)$ must take a highly restricted form.
\begin{proposition}
\end{proposition}
% \begin{remark}
%     \begin{enumerate*}
%         \item The action of the center $k^\times$ of $\GL(2,k)$ on lattices $L$ factors through $R^\times \lmod k^\times $, as $xL = L$  if (and only if) $x \in R^\times$. 
%     \end{enumerate*}
% \end{remark}
\paragraph*{Local Computations}
For now, let $k$ nonarchimedian local field of characteristic $0$, with ring of integers $R$ and maximal ideal $\pfrak$, with uniformizer $\pi$. Let $V$ be a two dimensional $k$-vectorspace, and $A = \End_k(V)$. Then every maximal order in $A$ takes the form
\begin{align*}
    \End_R(L) = \{ x \in A : xL\leq L\}
\end{align*}
where $L$ is a free $R$-module of rank $2$ in $V$. If $M = xL$ for some $x\in A^\times = \Aut_k(V)$, then $\End_R(M) = x\End_R(L)x^\inv$. As $A^\times$ acts transitively on the set of lattices in $V$ (by left-translation), it acts transitively on the set of maximal orders in $A$ (by conjugation). Further, if $\End_R(L)=\End_R(M)$ for two lattices $L,M$ in $V$, then there exists an $x \in k^\times$ such that $L = x M$. In this case, we say $L$ and $M$ are homothetic, and conclude that there is an $k^\times \lmod A^\times = \PGL(V)$ equivariant bijection between homothety classes of lattices in $V$ and maximal orders in $A$.
Given two lattices $L$ and $M$ in $V$, there exists a basis $u,v$ of $L$ such that $\pi^a u , \pi^b v$ is a basis for $M$ (elementary divisor theorem) and we set $d(L,M) = |a-b|$. If $x,y\in k^\times$ then $d(xL,yM)=d(L,M)$ so that $d$ descends to a function on homothety classes, or equivalently a function on maximal orders.

% Stealing some notation from Sally and Shalika: $k$ is the local field, with integers $\Ocal$, and $G=\SL_2(k)$. We let $K_m \leq \SL_2(k)$ be the kernel of the reduction mod $\Pcal^m$ map. $A$ is the diagonal split torus. 
%From Labesse and Langlands:
$F$ is a local field of characteristic zero, $G=\SL(2)$. Take a cartan subgroup $T$ of $G$, defined over $F$.  A special role will be played by the group $H^1(F,T)$.
Set $\tilde{G}=\GL_2$, then $\Tilde{T} = C_{\tilde{G}} (T)$ is a cartan subgroup of $\tilde{G}$. That $\tilde{G}$ has a single $\tilde{G}(F)$ conjugacy class of cartans, one has $H^1(F,\tilde{T}) = 1.$
Any $h\in \tilde{G}(F)=\GL(2,F)$ is a product $s^\inv g$ with $g\in G(\Fbar)=\SL(2,\Fbar)$ and $s \in \tilde{T}(\Fbar)$.
Let $L$ be the centralizer of $T(F)$ in the algebra of $2\times 2$ matrices over $F$. Then the \emph{set} of determinants of elements in $\tilde{T}(F)$ coincides with the algebra-theoretic norms of elements in $L^\times$.
The map $g \to \det h \mod \Nm{L/F} L^\times$ yields an identification of $F^\times / \Nm{L/F}$ with $H^1(F,T)$.
If $F$ is an extension of a field $E$, consider groups $G'$ defined over $E$ sandwhiched between the restrictions of scalars: $\Res_{L/E}G \leq G' \leq \Res_{L/E}\tilde{G}$. Then $G'$ is defined by a subgfroup $A$ of $\Res_{L/E} \Gbb_m$ and $G'(F) = \{ g \in \tilde{G}(F) \vert \det g \in A (E)\}$
Take $T' = C_{G'}(\Res_{F/E}T)$ and set $\Dfrak(T';E) = F^\times / A(E)\Nm{L/F}L^\times $. A slight extension is to consider $G' = \{ g \in \tilde{G} (F) \det g \in A\}$ for any closed subgroup $A$ of $F^\times$, which may or may not be the set of points of a group rational over some field.
Let $\kappa : X_* (T) \to \C^\times $ which is $\Gal(\Fbar)$ invariant.
The LLC associates to the pair $(T,\kappa)$ a group $H$, which must be either $G$ or $T$.
Fix haar measures on $G'$ and $T'$ and let $\gamma \in T'$ be regular. For $ h \in \tilde{G}(F)=\GL (2,F) $, we can transfer the measure on $T'$ to $h^\inv T' h $.
Def: $G'$ over $F$ is an inner twist if there exists an isomorphism $\psi: G' \to G$ defined over an extension $K/F$ such that $\sigma(\psi) \sigma ^\inv$ is inner for all $\sigma \in \Gal(K/F).$ Langlands' prediction is that there should be an injection of the automorphic representation of $G'(\Abb_F)$ into those of $G(\Abb_F)$
Consider $\gamma' \in G'(F)$, semi-simple, then the conjugacy class of $\psi(\gamma')$ is defined\footnote{what does this mean here? I think this means that the conjugacy class of $\psi(\gamma')$ is stable under $\Gal(K/F)$, perhaps pointwise so}  over $F$. Steinberg assures us that the conjugacy class of $\psi(\gamma')$ in $G(\Fbar)$ contains an element $\gamma \in G(F)$. This means that there is an injection of the elliptic (i.e. nonsplit) conjugacy classes of $G'(F)$ into those of $G(F)$. These classes form the indexing set for the respective trace formula for $G'$ and $G$. One wonders if this injection respects the orbital integrals in some sense.
For $\gamma \in T$ let $\gamma_1,\gamma_2 \in \bar{F}$ be its eigenvalues. When $T$ is split, the function $d(\gamma)= \frac{|(\gamma_1 -\gamma_2)^2|^{1/2}}{|\gamma_1\gamma_2|^{1/2}} $ will play a special role.
Fix a regular element $\gamma^0$ in $\tilde{T}(F))$ and let $\psi$ be a fixed nontrivial additive character of $F$. Fix an ordering $\gamma_1^0, \gamma_2^0$ on the eigenvalues of $\gamma^0$, which in turn determines an order on those for $\gamma$.
For a given regular $\gamma$, the quotient $\tilde{T}(F) \lmod \tilde{G}(F)$ may be identified with the orbit $\Ocal(\gamma)$ of $\gamma$ under $\tilde{G}(F)$ conjugation.
We arrange for the measure on $\tilde{T}(F)\lmod \tilde{G}))$ is of the ofrm $|\omega_\gamma |/|\gamma_1 - \gamma_2|$ for a certain form $\omega_\gamma$.
For $a\in F^\times$, set $\gamma(a) = a\tbt{1}{1}{0}{1}$. If $\tilde{T}$ is split and $a\in Z(T'),$ set $\Phi^{T'}(a,f)= |a|^\inv \int_{\Ocal(\gamma(a))} f(h) \dop h$.
For a quadratic extension $L/F$, regard $\tilde{G}(F)$ as the group of invertible $F$ linear transformations of  $L$. Then $\tilde{T}(F)= L^\times$ acting on $L$ by multiplication.
Pick an $F$ basis $\{1,\tau\}$ for $L$. Then there are $u,v \in F$ so that $\tau^2 = u \tau +v$.
If $\gamma = a+b\tau \in \tilde{T}(F)$ or $L^\times$, its eigenvalues are of the form $\gamma_1=a+b\tau$ and $\gamma_2 = a+b \bar{\tau}$ so that $\gamma_1-\gamma_2  = b (\tau -\bar{\tau})$.
In these coordinates, $\gamma$ corresponds to $\tbt{a}{bv}{b}{a+bu} $
For $g = \tbt{a_1}{b_1}{c_1}{d_1}$, then
$$\gamma^g = \tbt{*}{-b \Nm{L/F}(b_1+d_1v)/\det g}{b \Nm{L/F}(a_1+c_1v)/\det g}{*}$$
Let $\tilde{G}(\Ocal_F)$ be the stabilizer of $\Ocal_L$ in $\tilde{G}(F)$. After averaging a function $f$ on $\tilde{G}(F)$ over $\tilde{G}(\Ocal_F),$ we can assume that $f(g^k)=\kappa'(\det(k))f(g)$.
If $\pi$ is a uniformizer for $\Ocal_F$, then every double coset in $\tilde{T}(F)\lmod \tilde{G}(F) \rmod \tilde{G}(\Ocal_F)$ contains a $g$ so that $g\Ocal_L=\Ocal_F + \pi ^m \Ocal_F \tau$, for some $m \geq 0$.
Equivalently, in coordinates, it contains a representative of the form $\tbt{1}{0}{0}{\pi^m}$ for $m\geq 0$.
Every $g \in G'$ can be written as $g = n a k$ with $k \in K' = G' \cap \tilde{G}(O_F).$ Set $\beta(g) = \|\alpha/\beta\|$ if $g= n a k$ with $a =\tbt{\alpha}{}{}{\beta}$ and $\lambda(g) = \beta(g) + \beta(wg),$ so that $\lambda(g) = \beta(wn)$ when $g=nak$. For $\gamma \in A'$ regular, set $\Delta(\gamma) = \| \alpha - \beta \|/\| \alpha \beta \|^{1/2}$
Define distributions
\[ F(\gamma, f) = \Delta(\gamma) \int_{A \lmod G} f(g^\inv \gamma g ) \dop g \]
and
\[ A_1(\gamma, f) = \Delta(\gamma) \int_{A\lmod G} f(g^\inv \gamma g ) \ln \lambda(g) \dop g\]
Given a character $\eta$ of $A$, consider the representation $g \mapsto \rho(g,\eta)$ of $G$ acting by (right) translation on the space of smooth left $N(F)$ invariant functions on $G$ satisfying
\[ \phi(ag) = \eta (a)\beta(a)^{1/2}\phi(g) \]
for all $a \in A$. We can regard the space of $\rho(\eta)$ as a space of functions on $G(O_F).$ The space of functions is the same for $\eta$ as it is for $\eta_s: a \mapsto \eta(a) \beta(a)^s$
The kernel for $\rho(f,\eta)$ is given by
\[ K_\eta(k_1,k_2) = \int_A \int_{N(F)} f(k_1^\inv a n k_2 ) \lambda(a)^{1/2} \dop a \dop n\]
with the measure on $K'$ chosen so that
\[ \int_G f(g) \dop g = \int_A \int_{N(F)} \int_K f(ank) \dop a \dop n \dop k\]
% Langlands' setup:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item $T=T^G$  is a cartan subgroup of a reductive group  $G$ over a field $F$ of characteristic zero. 
% 	\item $\Afrak(T)=\Afrak(T,F)$ is the set of all $g\in G(\Fbar)$ for which $\Ad(g)T'=T$, and such that the morphism $t \mapsto t' = \Ad(g^\inv)t$ as well as $T'$ are defined over $F$. 
% 	\item $\Dfrak(T)=\Dfrak(T,F)=T(\Fbar)\lmod \Afrak(T)\rmod G(F)$. An element $g\in G(\Fbar)$ lies in $\Afrak(T)$ if and only if $a_\sigma = \sigma(g)g^\inv$ lies in $T(\Fbar)$ for all $\sigma \in \Gal(\Fbar/F)$.
% 	\item The collection  $\{ a_\sigma \vert \sigma \in \Gal(\Fbar/F) \}$ defines a cohomology class in $H^1(F,T)$ and the map $g \mapsto \{a_\sigma\} =\{\sigma(g)g^\inv\}$ yields an injection $\Dfrak(T) \to H^1(F,T)$. 
% 	\item The image of this injection is the kernel of $H^1(F,T)\to H^1(F,G)$ (which is somehow not always a group.) 
% 	\item The set $\Dfrak(T)$ parameterizes the conjugacy classes within a stable conjugacy class of $T$ (in $G(F)$). 
% 	\item $X_*(T)$ and $X_*(T_sc)$ are the lattices of coweights in $T$ and $T_{sc}$.  The latter can be identified with the sublattice of the former, generated by the co-roots. \end{itemize}
% 	%!TEX root = main.tex
Sally and Shalika notation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $k$ is a local field, $\Ocal$ its ring of integers, $\pfrak$ its maximal ideal, $q= \|\Ocal /\pfrak \|$ is assumed odd. 
	\item Normalize the haar measure $\dop x$ on $(k,+)$ so that $ \Ocal$ has measure $1$. 
	\item Define the valuation on $k$ via the equations $\dop (ax)= \|a\| \dop x$ for $a\in k$. Let $U= \{x\in k : \|x\|=1\} = \Ocal^\times$ and $U_n = 1 + \pfrak^n = \{x \in U : \|x-1\| \leq q^{-n}\}$
	\item $\tau$ denotes a fixed uniformizer of $\pfrak$, $\eps$ is a fixed generator for the $q-1$th roots of $1$ in $U$. 
\end{itemize}
For $V$ a quadratic extension of $k$, we let $\Nm{V/k}$ denote the norm map. Since $k$ has odd residual characteristic, $V$ is one of $k(\sqrt{\tau}),$ $k(\sqrt{\eps \tau}),$ or $k(\sqrt{\eps})$. The former two are ramified, and the latter is unramified. We will use $\theta$ to represent one of $\tau, \eps \tau,$ or $\eps$.  
\def\cond#1{{\rm cond}(#1)}
For $V=V_\theta = k(\sqrt{\theta})$, we let $C_\theta = \ker \Nm{V/k} \leq V^\times$ and $\pfrak_\theta$ the prime ideal in $V_\theta$. Set, in the unramified case, for $h\geq 1$:
	\[ C_\eps ^{h} = (1 +\pfrak_\eps ^h) \cap C_\eps \] 
and in either of the ramified cases, for $h\geq 0$:
	\[ C_\theta^h  = (1+\pfrak_\theta^{2h+1})\cap C_\theta.\]
Then, in any case, $\{ C_\theta ^h \}$ constitute a neighborhood base about $1$ in $C_\theta$. For a character $\psi \in \hat{C_\theta}$, write $\cond{\psi}$ for the largest subgroup in this filtration on which $\psi$ is trivial. For each $\theta,$ $C_\theta$ has a unique character of order $2$ which we denote by $\psi_o=\psi_{o,\theta}$. 
Let $G = \SL(2,k),$ $A=A(k)$ the diagonal subgroup (a maximal split torus). This subgroup is isomorphic to $k^\times$. We let $A_d$ denote the image of $U_d$ under this identification. 
Let $T$ be any compact cartan in $G$, which must be naturally isomorphic to some $C_\theta$. Let $T_d$ denote the image of $C_\theta ^d$ under such an identification. 
For a subset $S$ of $G$, let $S^G = \{ g s g^\inv : g \in G, s \in S\}$, and let $S'$ the subset of $S$ consisting of regular elements (those with distinct eigenvalues).

\section{From SS paper on fourier transforms}
For $f \in C_c^\infty(G)$, define, for $\gamma$ noncentral, the orbital integral 
	\[I_f (\gamma) = \int _{G/G_\gamma} f(x \gamma x^\inv) \dop \xdot \]
where $G_\gamma$ is the centralizer of $\gamma$ in $G=\SL(2,k)$ and $\dop \xdot$ is a $G$ invariant measure on $G/G_\gamma$. 
We can view the map $f\mapsto I_{f}$ as one from $C_c^\infty (G)$ to $C(G)^{\Inn(G)}$, i.e. sending functions on $G$ to class functions. The naive quotient of $G$ by $\Inn(G)$ is a singular space (owing to the non-regular elements, as well as the unipotent elements) 
\begin{align*}
	A &= \{ \Tbt{\lambda}{}{}{\lambda^\inv} : \lambda \in k^\times \}, & 	&	  \\
	T_\tau &= \{\Tbt{x}{y}{\tau y}{x} : x,y \in k\},  & T^\# _\tau &= \{\Tbt{x}{\eps y}{\tau \eps^\inv y}{x} : x,y \in k\} \\
	T_{\eps \tau} &= \{\Tbt{x}{y}{ \eps \tau y}{x} : x,y \in k\}, & T^\# _{\eps \tau} &= \{\Tbt{x}{\eps y}{\tau y}{x} : x,y \in k\}\\
	T_{\eps} &= \{\Tbt{x}{y}{ \eps y}{x} : x,y \in k\},  & T^\# _{\eps} &= \{\Tbt{x}{\tau y}{\eps \tau^\inv y}{x} : x,y \in k\}
\end{align*}
When $-1 \in (k^\times)^2$, these constitute a complete (and irredundant) set of conjugacy classes of cartans in $G$. 
When $-1 \notin (k^\times) ^2$, $T_\theta$ and $T_\theta^\#$ are conjugate for $\theta \in \{ \tau, \eps \tau\}$. 
The set of elliptic elements in $G$ is 
\[
	G_e = \bigcup_{T'} (T')^G,
\]
as $T'$ runs through the collection $\{ T_\theta, T^\#_\theta : \theta \in \{\tau,\eps \tau, \eps \}\}$ of compact cartans in $G$.

An admissible rep of $G$ is complex vector space $V$ and a $\rho : G \to \Aut(V)$ such that 
\begin{itemize}
	\item For all $v\in V$, the stabilizer of $v$ in $G$ is an open subgroup; this is needed for matrix coefficients of $V$ to be \emph{locally constant}. This is smoothness
	\item For each compact open subgroup $K\leq G,$ the $K$-fixed vectors $V^K$ form a finite dimensional subspace.
\end{itemize}
For a character $\mu :A \to \C^\times$, extend $\mu$ to $B=NA$ so that $\mu(n) =1$ for all $n\in N$, and define the space of $\Ind(\mu)$ to be the space of locally constant functions $f: G \to \C$ such that $f(n a g) = \delta^{1/2}(n a)\mu(n a)f(g)$. 
% For a group $G$ and a subgroup $H\leq G$, let $\pi : G \epi G/H$ be the canonical projection. Then $G$ is a principal $H$ bundle over $G/H$; this is tautological.
% Let $s: G/H \to G$ be a section (supposing one exists in the relevent category).  
% Given a representation $\rho$ of $H$ on a space $V$. The associated bundle is $G\times V \rmod (g,v) \sim (gh, \rho(h^\inv ) v) := G \times_H V \epi G/H$    via $\pi(g,v) = g H$. I.e.: sitting above each point $gH \in G/H$ is a copy of $V$.  
\def\Map{\rm Map}
% Let 
% \[
% \Map_H(G,V) = \{ f: G \to V \vert f(gh) = \rho(h^\inv) f(g)\, , (g,h) \in G\times H \}.
% \]
% This space of $V$ valued functions on $G$ can be identified with the space $\Gamma(E_V)=\Gamma(G,H,V)$ of sections $s: G/H \to E_V = G\times_H V$. Explicitly, given $f\in \Map_H(G,V)$, define a section $s$ by $s(gH)=(g,f(g)).$
In the description of $\Ind_B^G(\mu)$ as a space of functions on $G$ which are $(B,\mu)$  equivariant, view all of the $\Ind_B^G(\mu)$ as living inside some suitably large space of complex valued functions on $G$. One can do this in such a way that there is a consistent action of $G$ on functions \emph{by translation}. Other models substitute, for example, a consistent action for a consistent underlying space of functions. 
Keeping notation consistent with Bill's, $PS(\mu)$ is the principal series, and is associated to a $\mu : A \to \C^\times$. 
The definition of admissibility is designed so that the contragredient representation $\tilde{\rho}$ of admissible $\rho$ is admissible. The underlying space of $\tilde{\rho}$ is the collection of linear functionals on $\rho$ which are fixed by some open subgroup of $G$.
Integration yields a hermitian pairing $PS(\mu)\times PS(\mu^\inv ) \to \C$, so that $PS(\mu^\inv)$ is the contragredient to $PS(\mu)$. The underlying mechanism is that there is a unique $G$ invariant linear functional $I$ on $\Ind(\delta^{1/2})$ such that on the subspace of smooth compactly supported function $f: G \to \C$, one has $I(P_\delta f(g)) = \int_G f(g) \dop g$, where $P_\delta f(g) = \int _B f(bg) \dop b. $
Given an admissible representation $\rho$ of $G$ on a space $V$, set 
\[
	V(N) = \{ v  :  \int_\bfrak \rho(\tbt{1}{x}{0}{1} ) v \dop x = 0  \text{ some fractional ideal } \bfrak \}.
\]
% \subsection{Some comments on choices}
% Briefly lets let $\kfrak$ be algebraically closed, and $G=\GL(V)$ where $V$ is a two dimensional vectorspace over $\kfrak$
% Picking a maximal torus $T$ in $G$ amounts to picking a pair of linearly independent lines in $V.$ Note, this is not quite the same as picking a basis. These lines are the common eigenspaces of every element of $T$. 
% Picking (one of the two possible) orderings on the two roots of $T$ in $G$ amounts to a choice of borel $B$ containing $T$.

\section{Cartan Decomposition}
Let $G$ act on the set of ordered bases of $\kfrak^2$ by letting $g=\tbt{a}{b}{c}{d}$ send $(e_1,e_2)$ to $(ae_1 +b e_2 , ce_1 +de_2).$ 
Given an ordered basis $(e_1,e_2)$, let $\langle e_1,e_2\rangle = \ofrak e_1 + \ofrak e_2  \leq \kfrak^2$ be the lattice generated by it. 
Let $L=\langle u_1,u_2 \rangle $ be the lattice generated by the standard basis and $L'= gL$ the lattice generated by $g(u_1,u_2).$
Elementary divisor theorem implies there exists an $\ofrak$ basis $(v_1,v_2)$ of $L$ and elements $a_1,a_2 \in \kfrak^\times $ with $a_1 \in \ofrak a_2$ such that $(a_1v_1,a_2v_2)$ is a basis for $L'$. 
That is, there exists a $k_1 \in \GL_2(\ofrak)$ sending $(u_1,u_2)$ to $(v_1,v_2)$, and another $k_2 \in \GL_2(\ofrak)$ such that $k_2 g(u_1,u_2) = (a_1 v_1, a_2 v_2).$ If $a = \tbt{a_1}{}{}{a_2}$ then $k_2 g = a k_1$.  
Leting $A^{-}  = \{\tbt{a_1}{}{}{a_2}: \, a_1 \in a_2 \ofrak \}$, we have shown
\[ \boxed{
\GL_2(\kfrak) = \GL_2(\ofrak) \cdot A^{-} \cdot \GL_2(\ofrak), 
}\]
\section{Iwasawa decomposition} 
$\GL_2(\kfrak)$ acts transitively on $\Pbb^1(\kfrak)$. The stabilizer of any point is conjugate to the standard borel $B(\kfrak)$ of upper triangulars (equivalently, any point in $\Pbb^1$ can be taken to $\infty$).
Restricting the surjection $G(\kfrak) \to G(\kfrak) / B(\kfrak) = \Pbb^1(\kfrak)$ to $G(\ofrak)$ remains surjective, and induces an identification of $G(\ofrak) / B(\ofrak)$ with $\Pbb^1(\kfrak)$. 
\section{Iwahori factorization}
Every element $g \in G_o(\pfrak)$ has a unique decomposition $n^{-} b$ with $n^{-} \in N^{-}(\pfrak)$ and $b\in B(\ofrak)$:
\[ 
	\boxed{
		G_o(\pfrak) = N^{-} (\pfrak) B(\ofrak). 
	}
\]
Indeed, if $c\in \pfrak$ then $a \in \ofrak^\times$  and 
\[ \Tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} = \Tbt{1}{0}{c/a}{1} \cdot   \Tbt{a}{b}{0}{d-bc/a} \]%!TEX root = main.tex
For $\tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} \in G = \SL(2,k)$, if $c \in k^\times$ then one has 
\al{ 
    \Tbt{a}{b}{c}{d} &= \Tbt{-1}{}{}{-1}  \Tbt{c^\inv}{}{}{c} \Tbt{1}{ac}{}{1} \Tbt{}{1}{-1}{} \Tbt {1}{dc^\inv}{}{1} \\
    				 &= \abf (-1)\cdot \abf (c^\inv)\cdot \ubf (ac) \cdot \wbf \cdot \ubf(dc^\inv)
}
while if $c=0$, then $d=a^\inv$
\al{
	\Tbt{a}{b}{0}{a^\inv} &= \Tbt{a}{}{}{a^\inv} \Tbt{1}{ba^\inv}{}{1} \\
						  &= \abf(a)\ubf(ba^\inv) 
}
Here, $\abf: \Gbb_m \to G$ is the cocharacter corresponding to the split maximal torus $A \leq G$, $\ubf: \Gbb_a \to G$ parameterizes the associated root subgroup, and $\wbf = \tbt{}{1}{-1}{}$ is the weyl element.
For $b \in k^\times$, one has 
\al{
	\abf(b) &= w \cdot \ubf(b^\inv)\cdot w\cdot \ubf (b) \cdot w \cdot \ubf(b^\inv)
			}
Some computations for posterity: 
\al{
	w*g*w &= \left(\begin{array}{rr}
-d & c \\
b & -a
\end{array}\right) \\
	w*g	  &= \left(\begin{array}{rr}
c & d \\
-a & -b
\end{array}\right) \\
	g*w   &= \left(\begin{array}{rr}
-b & a \\
-d & c
\end{array}\right)

Given a group $G$, a field $k$, and a class function $\tau : G \to k$, say that a subgroup $H\leq G$ with $\tau(H) = S$ is $(S,\tau)$-maximal if for all $H < K \leq G$ with $\tau(H) = \tau(K)$, one has $H = K$. Let $X(S, \tau, G) $ be the collection of $(S, \tau)$ maximal subgroups of $G$.
Let $\Inn:G \to \Aut(G)$ denote the conjugation action $\Inn(g)x = g x g^\inv,$ at both the level of elements and subgroups. Then $X(S, \tau, G)$ is $\Inn(G)$ stable. 
Say that $S\subset k$ is $(\tau, G)$ if $\Inn(G)$ acts transitively on $X(S, \tau, G)$.

\section{The metatheorem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $B$ be an indefinite quaternion algebra over a number field $K$, satisfying condition  (*)\footnote{$K$ should be  a totally real field, with odd class number, and $B$ should be a split over a unique real place of $K$}. 
Let $\Nrd: B\to K$, and $\Trd: B \to K$ denote the reduced norm and trace maps respectively. The canonical involution $\bar{\cdot}$ on $B$ satisfies $x\bar{x} = \Nrd(x) 1 \in K$ and  $x+\bar{x} = \Trd(X) 1 \in K$, where we identify in both cases $K$ with the center of $B$. 
Further, suppose that $B$ has type number $1$, so that $B$ has a unique $B^\times$ conjugacy class of maximal orders. Pick one, say $\Ofrak$. 
% \begin{itemize}
% 		 	\item $p$ in $P < \Ocal < K$, $\pi$ in $\Pcal$;
% 		  	\item $q_n : \Ocal \to Q_n = \Ocal / \Pcal^n$, $q  = q_n, k = Q_1$;
% 		  	\item Pick a section $\xi_n : Q_n \to \Ocal $compatible with transition map
% 		  	\item $G$ semisimple rank 1 over $K$; $\gfrak$ its lie algebra
% 		  	\item $r_n : G(\Ocal) \to G(Q_n)$ induced by map on $\Ocal$;
% 		  		\begin{itemize}
% 		  			\item $A$ is the maximally split torus in $G$. As an algebraic group is $\Gbb_m$, since rank 1. 
% 		  			\item Pick a root $\alpha: A \to \Gbb_m $, and designate it positive, let $u=u_\alpha: \Gbb_a \to G$ be a parameterization of the associated unipotent $U=U_\alpha$; 
% 		  			\item $B$ is the associated borel, with unipotent radical $U$, and factorization $B=AU$ semidirect, with $\Ad(a)u(x)= u(\alpha(a) x)$ for $a \in A$ and $x\in \Gbb_a$. The opposite unipotent is $\Ubar=U_{-\alpha}$, one which $A$ acts by the character $\alpha^\inv$. 
% 		  			\item The sequence $\Gbb_a \xrightarrow{u_\alpha} B \to B/U$ exhibits $B$ as a line bundle over $B/U$. The cocharacter $\check{\alpha}: \Gbb_m \to A \leq B \leq G$ yields a section: $\check{\alpha} \times u : \Gbb_m \times \Gbb_a \to B$ are global coordinates on this (apparently trivial) bundle. 
% 		  			\item $A$ acts on the fibers of $B \xrightarrow{\alpha} A$. In $u$ coordinates:
% 						\al{
% 						a\cdot u(x)\cdot a' \cdot u(y) 
% 						&= a \cdot \Ad(a')u(x) \cdot  u(y) \\
% 						&=  a \cdot u(a'^\alpha  u) \cdot u(y) \\
% 						&= a \cdot u(  a'^\alpha  x + y )
% 							}
% 					\al{ 
% 						u(x)\cdot a\cdot u(y) 
% 						&= \Ad(a) u(a^{-\alpha} x) \cdot a \cdot u(y) \\
% 				   		&= a \cdot u(a^{-\alpha} x )\cdot u(y) \\
% 				   		&= a \cdot u(a^{-\alpha} x +y)
% 				   			}
% 	  				shows that the action of $U= \Gbb_a$ on the line affine line $\Abb^1 = \{a\} \times U$ over $a \in A$ in $B$ is 
% \[  x \times y \mapsto a^{- \alpha} x + y \]
% 		  		\end{itemize}
% 		  	\item $\rho_n : G(Q_n) \to G(\Ocal)$ a section of $r_n$; 
% 		  	\item $\tau : G(K; \Ocal; Q_n) \to K; \Ocal; Q_n$, natural and $\Inn(G) (K; \Ocal; Q_n)$ invariant 
% 				% \subitem Open subsets of $K$ of form $ q_n^\inv (S)$ for a (finite) subset $S$ subset $Q^n$. It is of the form $\cup_{s in S} q_n^\inv(s) s  = \cup_{s in S} (\sig_n(s) + \Pcal^n)$
% 				% \subitem Open subsets of $G(K)$ 
% \end{itemize} 
% For $S \subset G$, write $S^G = \cup_{s \in S} s^G = \cup_{s\in S, g\in G} \{ s^g\}$.

\title{On $q,\tau,$ and $s$ (or: on what`s in a name?)}
\author{Justin Katz}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
Cultural norms dictate that the complex variables $q$ and $\tau$ should be related by an identity like 
\begin{align*}
	 q = \exp(2\pi i \tau) \text{ or } \exp (\pi i \tau)
\end{align*}
and that $\tau$ should run about the upper halfplane $\half$.
Similarly, the variable $s$ is typically reserved for the exponent in dirichlet series, e.g. 
\begin{align*}
	\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s}. 	
\end{align*}
The goal of this document is to explicate the `nature' of the variables $\tau,q,$ and $s$: to describe an intrinsic description of their domain and codomain.
\section{On $s$}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The variable $s$ seems to live as a parameter on some manner of dual space: e.g. $\Hom(\C^\times , \C^\times)= \{ \cdot \mapsto \cdot^s:  s\in \C\}$. 
\end{itemize}
