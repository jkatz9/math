	Dear Blank,
I am currently a graduate student in Mathematics at UC Berkeley, and expect
to receive my Ph.D. in May of 2014. I am interested in any postdoctoral positions
you may be offering this year.1
My research interests lie primarily in the field of Blank. In your department
I would be interested in working with Professor blank(1) and Professor blank(2).
My thesis, Blankety blank, was written under the supervision of Prof. Blank. In	addition, during the period I have been at Berkeley, I have taught several courses,
including blank and blank.
Enclosed is my Curriculum vitae, and a research statement. In addition, you
should be receiving letters of recommendation on my behalf from Blank(1), Blank(2),
. . . , Blank(n). I would be happy to supply any further materials you require.
Thank you, Blank.
