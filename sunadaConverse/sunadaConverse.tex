\title{On a converse to Sunada}
\author{Justin Katz}

\begin{document}
\maketitle 

 
Sunada introduced a group theoretic mechanism for producing pairs of isospectral manifolds. In this note, I formulate a converse to that construction and discuss some avenues by which one might prove them.

\paragraph{Gassman triples}
Let $G$ be a finite group and $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ subgroups. We say that the triple $(G,H_{1},H_{2})$ is Gassman, or that $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ are almost conjugate in $G$, if any of the following three equivalent conditions are met:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For any  $G$-conjugacy class $C \subset G$,  the cardinality of the set $C\cap H_{i}$ is independent of $i$.\
	\item The $\Q[G]$ isomorphism type of $\Q[G/H_{i}]$ is independent of $i$
	\item The $k[G]$ isomorphism type of $k[G/H_{i}]$ is independent of $i$ for any field $k$ of characteristic zero.
	\item For any irreducible representation $(\rho,V)$ of $G$, the dimension of $V^{H_{i}}$ is independent of $i$. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Sunada diamonds}
Let $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ be closed Riemannian manifolds, and suppose that the universal covers $\tilde{M_{i}}$, equipped with the pullback metric, are isometric; in this case write $\tilde{M}$ for $\tilde{M_{i}}$.   Write $\Gamma_{i} = \pi_{1}(M_{i})$, which we view as subgroups of $\Isom(\tilde{M})$ acting by deck transformations of the universal covering map, so that $M_{i} \approx \Gamma_{i} \lmod \tilde{M}$. We say that $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are \textbf{commensurable} if they admit a common finite Riemannian cover, and \textbf{strongly commensurable} if furthermore there is a Riemannian manifold admitting both $M_1$ and $M_2$ as finite Riemannian covers.  Then $M_1$ and $M_2$ are commensurable if, after a suitable conjugation, the intersection $\Gamma_1\cap \Gamma_2$ has finite index in both $\Gamma_i$, and are strongly commensurable if each $\Gamma_i$ has finite index in the group generated by the product $\Gamma_1\Gamma_2$ in $\Isom(\tilde{M})$. 

Suppose now that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are strongly commensurable, with common cover $M_{o}$, commonly covering $M$, and that the cover $M_{o} \to M$ is regular, with deck group $G$. If $\Gamma = \pi_{1}(M)$ and $\Gamma_{o} = \pi_{1}(M_{o})$ then this assumption amounts to $\Gamma_{o} \triangleleft \Gamma$ and $\Gamma/\Gamma_{o} = G$.

\end{tikzcd}\]


Taking  a finite cover, if necessary, we assume that the cover $M \to M_{o}$ is regular, and set $G=\Gal(M/M_{o})$. Let $H_{i} = \Gal(M/M_i)$ denote the subgroups corresponding to the intermediate covers $M \epi M_i$ for $i=1,2$. Letting $G$ act on $M$ by deck transformations, the diagram above is
