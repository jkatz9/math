\maketitle
As a heterosexual white cis male from an upper middle class whole family, I have not experienced systematic oppression, but I am working hard to understand the many facets of inequality in America. In particular, I understand that many oppressed peoples feel that the mathematics community is an unsafe environment. Furthermore I believe that a working knowledge of mathematics is tremendously empowering, especially in the workforce. I consider it a crucial obligation to use my privilege to affect positive change in the classroom through careful sensitivity to social and cultural differences in my students.
