\maketitle
I believe that diversity and inclsuivity are a fundamental source of institutional strength. As an instructor, I work to ensure that my classroom is a safe environment for all people, regardless of ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender expression, or socioeconomic class. Furthermore, I understand that a path to genuine equity in higher education requires an approach which is adaptive to students backgrounds, and subsequent needs. To this end, I am committed to making myself available to students for the purpose of establishing a personalized framework.  I recognize my position as one of privilege, and am enthusiastically receptive to opportunities wherein I can learn to be a more supportive ally to marginalized communities.
